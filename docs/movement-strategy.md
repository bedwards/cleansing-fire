## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This is not a history lesson. The history is in
[Historical Power Rebalancing](historical-research.md). This is not a theory
document. The game theory is in [Game Theory](game-theory.md). This is not an
economics treatise. The economic model is in [The Ember Economy](economics.md).
This is not a power mapping database. That infrastructure is in
[Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md). And this is not a humor manual.
The satire playbook is in [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md).

This document is about **how to actually build and sustain a movement** that can
use all of those tools. It answers the questions those documents leave open:

- You understand historical patterns. Now how do you apply them?
- You can map corporate power. Now how do you build power to counter it?
- You have game-theoretic models. Now how do you get millions of people to
  coordinate?
- You have an alternative economic vision. Now how do you get from here to there?
- You know humor is a weapon. Now who wields it, how are they organized, and how
  do they stay safe?

The enemy is not left or right. The enemy is **corporate capture of democratic
institutions** -- the slow, systematic replacement of "one person, one vote"
with "one dollar, one vote." This is the framing that makes broad coalition
possible, and broad coalition is the only thing that wins.

# 1. COALITION ARCHITECTURE

## 1.1 The Core Insight: It's Not Left vs. Right

The most important strategic decision for any movement against corporate capture
is the decision to refuse the left-right frame. This is not a tactical choice.
It is the foundational architecture decision on which everything else depends.

Here is why. The left-right axis is the primary tool corporations use to prevent
coalition. A pharmaceutical company charging $300 for insulin that costs $3 to
manufacture does not benefit from the existence of a unified "people who need
insulin" constituency. It benefits from that constituency being split into
"conservatives who think government regulation is the problem" and "liberals who
think corporate greed is the problem." Both are partially right. Neither can win
alone. The company wins as long as they fight each other.

The correct frame is: **people vs. concentrated unaccountable power.** This frame
is accurate (it describes what is actually happening), it is inclusive (it
doesn't require anyone to abandon their existing political identity), and it is
strategically optimal (it creates the largest possible coalition).

The [Historical Research](historical-research.md) documents this pattern
repeatedly. The Indian independence movement succeeded because Gandhi framed it
as Indians vs. colonial extraction, not Hindu vs. Muslim, not urban vs. rural,
not radical vs. moderate. The American civil rights movement succeeded when it
framed lunch counter sit-ins not as "Black power" but as "American values of
equality being violated." Successful movements define the line of conflict to
maximize their side and minimize the opponent's.

## 1.2 Lessons from Recent Movements

### Occupy Wall Street (2011)

**What worked:** The "99% vs. 1%" frame was a masterstroke. It bypassed left-right
entirely. A Tea Party voter and a progressive activist could both see themselves
in the 99%. The framing permanently shifted the American conversation about
inequality. Before Occupy, mainstream media almost never discussed income
inequality. After Occupy, it became a standard political issue.

**What failed:** No organizational infrastructure to translate energy into power.
No specific demands. No escalation strategy. No leadership model that could make
decisions. The General Assembly consensus model meant that a single disruptor
could block any action. Camps became ends in themselves rather than means to
political change. The movement was deliberately leaderless in a way that prevented
strategic coordination.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** Framing brilliance without organizational
infrastructure is a firework, not a fire. You need both.

### The Tea Party (2009-2016)

**What worked:** Extraordinary organizational discipline despite appearing
grassroots. Focused on a specific, achievable lever of power: Republican
primaries, where turnout is low and a small organized minority can determine
outcomes. Built from local chapters upward. Created real consequences for
politicians who didn't comply (primary challengers). Maintained message
discipline around a small number of clear demands.

**What failed:** Quickly captured by corporate funders (Koch brothers, FreedomWorks)
who redirected populist energy toward corporate-friendly policies (deregulation,
tax cuts for the wealthy) that contradicted the movement's original anti-bailout
anger. The "grassroots" became "astroturf" -- the term was literally coined for
this phenomenon.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** The Tea Party's *organizational model* (primary
challenges, local chapters, message discipline) was brilliant. Its *funding
model* was its fatal vulnerability. See [Section 7: Fundraising Without
Capture](#7-fundraising-without-capture) for how to get the former without the
latter.

### Black Lives Matter (2013-2020)

**What worked:** Decentralized chapter model allowed local adaptation. The hashtag
created a shared identity without requiring a single organization. The 2020
George Floyd protests became the largest protest movement in American history (15-26
million participants). Shifted the Overton window on policing -- concepts like
"defund the police" went from unthinkable to debatable in weeks.

**What failed:** Decentralization without accountability led to financial scandals
at the national organization level. The "defund the police" slogan, while
analytically defensible, was a narrative disaster -- it allowed opponents to
define the movement by its most radical-sounding demand rather than its most
popular ones (accountability, transparency, de-escalation training). Internal
conflicts between national organization and local chapters were never resolved.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** Decentralization is essential but insufficient. You
need **decentralization with accountability** -- exactly the problem the
[Game Theory](game-theory.md) document's mechanism design section addresses.
And narrative discipline matters: see [Section 3: Narrative Warfare](#3-narrative-warfare).

### #MeToo (2017-present)

**What worked:** Used personal testimony as a weapon against institutional cover-up.
Created a template anyone could use (share your story with the hashtag). Achieved
actual consequences for powerful individuals (Harvey Weinstein's conviction, dozens
of firings and resignations). Changed norms around what behavior was tolerable.

**What failed:** Individual accountability without structural change. The systems
that enabled harassment (NDAs, forced arbitration, HR departments that protect
the company not the employee) are still largely intact. The movement had no
mechanism for moving from "name and shame individuals" to "change the structures
that produce the behavior."

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** Personal stories are enormously powerful for
breaking silence and shifting norms. But structural change requires structural
strategy. The escalation ladder ([Section 5](#5-the-escalation-ladder)) maps
how to get from individual testimony to institutional reform.

### Hong Kong Protests (2019-2020)

**What worked:** "Be water" -- a radically adaptive strategy named after a Bruce
Lee quote. No permanent leadership to arrest. Rapid tactical adaptation via
Telegram and LIHKG forum. Extraordinary operational security (protesters wore
masks, used umbrellas against facial recognition, paid with cash). Created
shared symbols (the yellow umbrella) and shared practices (hand signals for
supply needs) without centralized coordination. Built international solidarity
through savvy English-language social media campaigns.

**What failed:** Ultimately crushed by raw state power (National Security Law,
mass arrests, elimination of free press). The movement had no international
leverage sufficient to counter Chinese state authority. No escalation path
beyond protest that didn't lead to massacre.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** The operational playbook was extraordinary and
directly applicable. The strategic lesson is harsh: decentralized protest
without institutional power to protect it is vulnerable to authoritarian
crackdown. Movements in democratic systems have leverage that Hong Kong did not
-- they must use it before it erodes further.

### India Farmers' Protests (2020-2021)

**What worked:** Sustained encampment at Delhi borders for over a year. Cross-caste,
cross-religious coalition (Sikh, Hindu, Muslim farmers cooperated). Disciplined
nonviolence maintained despite government provocations. Clear, specific demand
(repeal three farm laws). Created their own media infrastructure (Trolley Times
newspaper, social media teams). Brought their own food, built temporary
structures, ran community kitchens (langars). Won: the laws were repealed.

**What failed:** Victory was narrow -- the laws were repealed, but the underlying
corporate agriculture push continues through other mechanisms. The coalition was
issue-specific and did not generalize into broader anti-corporate-capture
movement.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** This is the model for sustained, disciplined,
cross-identity coalition around a specific demand. Key insight: they fed
themselves. Literal self-sufficiency (growing and cooking their own food)
created independence from systems that could be used to pressure them.
The Ember Economy's principle of [reduced dependence on
extractive systems](economics.md) is the same logic generalized.

### Climate Movement (Fridays for Future, Sunrise, XR, 2018-present)

**What worked:** Greta Thunberg's moral clarity cut through political calculation.
Sunrise Movement's inside/outside strategy (protests + lobbying + primary
challenges) was more effective than pure protest. XR's escalation tactics
(bridge blockades, die-ins) forced media coverage.

**What failed:** The climate movement has thus far failed to achieve structural
change commensurate with the scale of the crisis. Fragmentation between
organizations with different theories of change. "Climate anxiety" paralysis
among supporters. The fossil fuel industry's counter-narrative apparatus (see
[Section 3](#3-narrative-warfare)) is vastly better funded.

**Lesson for Cleansing Fire:** Moral clarity is necessary but not sufficient.
You need organizational infrastructure to convert moral energy into political
power. The Sunrise Movement's approach -- combining grassroots mobilization with
electoral strategy and specific policy demands (Green New Deal) -- is closest to
the full-spectrum model this document advocates.

## 1.3 The Coalition Architecture Framework

Based on these lessons, here is a practical architecture for building broad
coalitions against corporate capture:

### Layer 1: The Unifying Frame

Define the conflict as **people vs. concentrated unaccountable power**, not left
vs. right. Never let opponents redefine it. Every communication, every campaign,
every public statement should reinforce this frame.

Practical test: If a Fox News viewer and an MSNBC viewer can both nod at your
core message, your frame is right. If only one nods, your frame is wrong.

### Layer 2: The Big Tent with Clear Walls

A coalition is not "everyone." It has boundaries. The boundary for this coalition
is: **you cannot be a coalition member and also be actively working to increase
corporate capture of democratic institutions.** That means:

- A libertarian who opposes corporate subsidies? In.
- A progressive who opposes corporate lobbying? In.
- A conservative who opposes bailouts for big banks? In.
- A corporate lobbyist? Out.
- A politician who takes corporate PAC money and votes for corporate interests? Out (but can get in by changing behavior).

This is not a purity test. It is a conflict-of-interest test.

### Layer 3: Issue-Specific Entry Points

People don't join "the movement." They join because of a specific issue that
affects them:

- **Insulin pricing** (healthcare)
- **Student debt** (education)
- **Rent costs** (housing)
- **Wages vs. CEO pay** (labor)
- **Water contamination** (environment)
- **Data privacy** (tech)
- **Farm consolidation** (agriculture)
- **Media monopoly** (information)

Each of these is an entry point into the same structural analysis: corporations
using captured regulatory systems to extract wealth from people. The coalition
architecture connects these single-issue campaigns to each other through shared
infrastructure and shared analysis.

### Layer 4: Federated Structure

Inspired by the [federation protocol](federation-protocol.md) concept, the
organizational model is federated:

- **Local chapters** are autonomous. They choose their own campaigns, their own
  tactics (within shared principles), their own leadership.
- **Regional coordination** enables mutual aid, shared resources, coordinated
  actions across chapters.
- **National/international coordination** maintains the shared frame, coordinates
  major campaigns, handles media, manages shared infrastructure (legal defense,
  communication platforms, training).
- **No single point of failure.** If the national level is compromised or
  collapses, local chapters continue.

### Layer 5: Cross-Movement Solidarity

Actively build relationships with adjacent movements:

- Show up for other movements' actions.
- Provide logistical support (legal observers, medics, food).
- Amplify other movements' messaging.
- Find the corporate power connections between issues (the same private equity
  firm that's buying up housing is also buying up hospitals and nursing homes).

The [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md) is the tool that makes this
visible. When you can show a housing activist and a healthcare activist that the
same Blackstone subsidiary is driving both of their problems, coalition becomes
obvious rather than theoretical.

# 2. DIGITAL ORGANIZING 2.0

## 2.1 The Platform Problem

Every major platform where organizing has historically happened is now either
hostile, unreliable, or surveilled (often all three):

- **Facebook/Meta:** Algorithmic suppression of organizing content, data sharing
  with law enforcement, advertising model that incentivizes outrage over
  coordination.
- **Twitter/X:** Under Elon Musk, actively hostile to left-of-center and
  progressive organizing, unreliable API, algorithmic manipulation.
- **Instagram:** Same ownership as Meta, same problems, plus visual-only format
  limits complex communication.
- **TikTok:** Potential ban, Chinese government data access concerns, algorithm
  optimizes for virality not organizing, content disappears from feeds quickly.
- **Reddit:** Increasingly commercialized, API lockdown killed many community
  tools, subreddit model can be captured by hostile moderators.

The lesson is not "social media is useless." It is: **you cannot build your
movement's infrastructure on someone else's platform.** Social media is a
megaphone, not a foundation.

## 2.2 The Communication Stack

A serious movement needs a layered communication infrastructure:

### Broadcast Layer (Public)

Purpose: reach new people, shift public narrative, create virality.

**Tools:**
- Social media (all platforms -- go where the people are, don't pledge loyalty to
  any platform)
- Podcasts (low barrier, hard to censor, building dedicated audiences)
- YouTube/video (tutorials, explainers, documentary content)
- Newsletters (Substack, Ghost, self-hosted -- email lists you control)
- Public websites

**Key principle:** Use these platforms, but never depend on them. Every post should
drive people toward channels you control (email list, your own app, your own
website). Think of social media as rented land. Build on land you own.

### Coordination Layer (Semi-public)

Purpose: coordinate actions, share tactics, build community among committed
participants.

**Tools:**
- **Signal groups** (encrypted, no metadata collection, but limited to ~1000
  members per group, and group management is primitive)
- **Matrix/Element** (federated, encrypted, self-hostable, better group
  management than Signal, but steeper learning curve)
- **Discord** (good UX but not encrypted, company can shut down servers, useful
  for lower-security coordination)
- **Mattermost** (self-hosted Slack alternative, full control)
- **Discourse** (self-hosted forum software, good for longer discussions)

**Key principle:** The coordination layer should be **federated or self-hosted**.
You should be able to survive the loss of any single platform. This aligns
directly with the [Decentralized Systems](decentralized-systems.md) architecture.

### Secure Layer (Private)

Purpose: sensitive planning, legal coordination, security discussions.

**Tools:**
- **Signal** (one-on-one and small group, disappearing messages enabled)
- **Briar** (works without internet via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, designed for activists
  under repressive regimes)
- **OnionShare** (file sharing over Tor)
- **Tails OS** (amnesic operating system, leaves no trace on the computer)
- **Air-gapped devices** (for the most sensitive communications)

**Key principle:** Assume everything digital can be compromised. The secure layer
is for planning that would be dangerous if intercepted. See
[Section 6: Security Culture](#6-security-culture) for threat modeling.

## 2.3 The IRL-Digital Hybrid Model

The most effective organizing model for the 2020s is neither purely digital nor
purely in-person. It is a hybrid:

**Digital for:**
- Rapid coordination across geography
- Broadcast and recruitment
- Archiving and knowledge sharing
- Connecting isolated individuals to community
- Real-time tactical communication during actions

**IRL (In Real Life) for:**
- Trust building (you cannot build deep trust through a screen)
- Training (de-escalation, legal rights, first aid, media training)
- Decision-making on sensitive matters
- Community building (shared meals, social events, mutual aid)
- Actions themselves (protests, direct actions, community meetings)

**The 2:1 Rule:** For every two digital touchpoints, ensure at least one
in-person touchpoint. A member who only interacts digitally is a follower, not
an organizer.

### The Organizing Conversation

Digital tools do not replace the most powerful organizing tool ever invented:
**the one-on-one conversation.** Marshall Ganz's organizing model (developed
from his work with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers) centers on
structured one-on-one conversations that:

1. **Identify shared values** (not just shared interests)
2. **Connect personal experience to structural analysis** ("Why do you think your
   rent went up 40%? Let me show you who bought your building...")
3. **Ask for commitment** (not just agreement -- "Will you come to the meeting
   Thursday?")
4. **Build relationship** (the organizer genuinely cares about the person, not
   just their vote/attendance)

This is labor-intensive. It does not scale like a viral tweet. It builds power
that a viral tweet cannot.

## 2.4 Platform Resilience

Build your digital infrastructure to survive:

- **Platform bans:** Have backup channels for every primary channel. When you set
  up a Discord, also set up a Matrix. When you build a Twitter following, also
  build an email list.
- **Internet shutdowns:** Briar works over Bluetooth mesh. Have printed contact
  lists and meeting points established in advance. Practice "dark" operations
  (functioning without internet).
- **Infiltration:** Compartmentalize. Not everyone needs access to everything.
  See [Section 6](#6-security-culture).
- **Disinformation:** Establish verified spokesperson protocols. When only
  verified accounts can make official statements, it's harder to inject fake ones.

## 2.5 Tools to Build

The Cleansing Fire project should prioritize building or supporting:

1. **A federated organizing platform** -- combining the features of Signal (encryption),
   Discord (community management), and ActionNetwork (event management, RSVP
   tracking, email lists) in a self-hostable, federated package.
2. **A power-mapping tool** that connects to the [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md)
   data infrastructure -- letting local chapters map their local power structures
   and connect them to the national/global map.
3. **A secure whistleblower channel** -- allowing people inside corporations to
   share information about corporate wrongdoing with movements and journalists,
   with strong source protection.
4. **Counter-narrative tools** -- the satirical content creation infrastructure
   described in [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md), made accessible to
   non-technical organizers.

# 3. NARRATIVE WARFARE

## 3.1 How Corporations Control Narratives

The [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md) documents the structural
apparatus of corporate power. This section documents how that power is
**narratively maintained** -- how corporations control not just what people do but
what they believe is possible.

### The Narrative Control Infrastructure

**PR Firms:** The top 5 global PR firms (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic,
Dentsu) represent a combined annual revenue exceeding $60 billion. Their clients
include fossil fuel companies, pharmaceutical companies, tech monopolies, and
governments. They don't just manage reputation -- they manufacture reality. When
ExxonMobil needed to delay climate action, it hired the same PR firms that had
defended tobacco. When pharmaceutical companies need to justify price increases,
they fund "patient advocacy groups" that echo industry talking points.

**Think Tanks:** Organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute,
the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heartland Institute produce
intellectual cover for corporate-friendly policies. They employ credentialed
experts who publish papers, give congressional testimony, and appear on cable
news. The funding is corporate but the output looks like independent scholarship.
This is the laundering of corporate interests into "ideas."

**Media Ownership:** Six corporations control approximately 90% of American media.
Local newspapers have been hollowed out by private equity (Alden Global Capital
alone owns over 200 newspapers, gutting their newsrooms for profit). The result
is "news deserts" -- communities with no local journalism, where corporate
misconduct goes unreported.

**Astroturfing:** Manufacturing the appearance of grassroots support. The fossil
fuel industry's "Energy Citizens" campaign created fake rallies. Pharmaceutical
companies fund "patient groups" that lobby against drug price regulation.
Tech companies fund "innovation" nonprofits that oppose antitrust enforcement.

**Academic Capture:** Corporate funding of university research shapes what
questions get asked and what answers get amplified. The Koch brothers have
funded economics departments at over 300 universities, with contractual influence
over hiring and curriculum.

### The Six Corporate Narratives

Almost all corporate narrative control deploys variations of six master narratives:

1. **"There Is No Alternative" (TINA):** The current system is the only possible
   system. Any alternative would be worse. This is Thatcher's formulation, and it
   is the most powerful corporate narrative because it forecloses imagination.

2. **"Innovation Will Save Us":** Don't regulate; let the market innovate. This
   narrative transforms the arsonist into the firefighter -- the companies
   causing the problem will also solve it, if you just let them.

3. **"Jobs vs. Environment":** Any regulation will destroy jobs. This pits
   workers against environmentalists, splitting the coalition. (In reality, the
   same companies threatening job losses are simultaneously automating those jobs
   away.)

4. **"Personal Responsibility":** The problem is individual behavior, not
   systemic structure. BP invented the "carbon footprint" calculator to shift
   climate blame from corporations to consumers. Fast food companies blame
   obesity on individual choices, not addictive food engineering.

5. **"Freedom = Deregulation":** Government regulation is tyranny. Corporate
   power is freedom. This conflates consumer choice (picking between five
   brands owned by the same conglomerate) with genuine self-determination.

6. **"Complexity = Inaction":** The issue is too complex for simple solutions.
   We need more study. This is the delay tactic -- used for decades on climate,
   tobacco, lead paint, PFAS, and every other corporate harm.

## 3.2 Counter-Narrative Strategy

### Frame Analysis

Before you can fight a narrative, you have to see it. Frame analysis is the
practice of identifying the underlying assumptions in any communication:

**Exercise: Frame Identification**

Take any corporate press release or political speech. For each claim, ask:

1. **What is taken for granted?** (What doesn't need to be argued because it's
   assumed?)
2. **What is excluded?** (What options or facts are not mentioned?)
3. **Who benefits from this frame?** (If everyone accepted this frame, who wins?)
4. **What is the alternative frame?** (How would you describe the same situation
   from a different set of assumptions?)

**Example:**

Corporate statement: "We are committed to sustainability and have reduced our
carbon emissions by 15% since 2019."

- **Taken for granted:** Voluntary corporate action is the appropriate mechanism
  for addressing emissions. 15% is meaningful progress.
- **Excluded:** Total emissions are still massive. The 15% reduction came from
  offshoring production, not actually reducing pollution. The company lobbied
  against mandatory emissions standards.
- **Who benefits:** The company, which gets credit for action without being held
  to binding standards.
- **Alternative frame:** "This company has blocked mandatory emissions reductions
  while making voluntary reductions that amount to less than 3% per year -- far
  below what science requires. Their reported numbers exclude their supply chain,
  which produces 80% of their actual emissions."

### Counter-Narrative Injection

Once you've identified the corporate frame, you can inject counter-narratives.
The [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md) document provides an extensive
toolkit for this, including parody, detournement, and strategic absurdity. Here
we focus on the structural approach:

**Step 1: Identify the narrative target.** Which of the six corporate narratives
is being deployed?

**Step 2: Prepare the counter-frame.** Don't argue within their frame -- replace it.

| Corporate Narrative | Counter-Frame |
|---|---|
| "There Is No Alternative" | "There are alternatives. They just threaten the people in charge." |
| "Innovation Will Save Us" | "The same companies that created the problem are promising to fix it -- if you stop regulating them." |
| "Jobs vs. Environment" | "The CEO threatening job losses just gave himself a $20 million bonus. He's using you as a human shield." |
| "Personal Responsibility" | "They made you feel guilty about your plastic straw while dumping 10,000 tons of waste into the river." |
| "Freedom = Deregulation" | "Your 'freedom' to choose between four insurance companies that all deny claims is not freedom." |
| "Complexity = Inaction" | "It's only 'complex' because they're paying to make it complex." |

**Step 3: Choose your channel.** Different counter-narratives work in different
media:

- **Social media:** Short, punchy, shareable. The counter-frame table above is
  designed for this.
- **Longform content:** Detailed investigations, data journalism, documentaries.
  For audiences who want evidence.
- **Humor and satire:** The most effective channel for narratives that are
  defended by authority (see [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md), Section 1.1
  on why ridicule has no defense).
- **Personal testimony:** For narratives that deny harm. Real people telling real
  stories about real consequences.
- **Visualization:** Charts, infographics, maps. For making invisible power
  structures visible.

**Step 4: Repetition and coordination.** A counter-narrative mentioned once is
noise. A counter-narrative repeated consistently across dozens of voices and
channels becomes the new frame. This requires the coalition infrastructure from
[Section 1](#1-coalition-architecture) and the communication stack from
[Section 2](#2-digital-organizing-20).

### Strategic Storytelling

Humans are narrative animals. Data changes minds sometimes. Stories change minds
almost always. The most effective movement communications follow a structure:

1. **A person** (not an abstraction -- a person with a name and a face)
2. **A problem** (something concrete that happened to them)
3. **A villain** (not "the system" but a specific decision-maker who made a
   specific choice)
4. **A vision** (what could be different)
5. **A path** (what the audience can do right now)

**Bad example:** "Corporate consolidation in the healthcare industry has led to
increased prices and decreased access."

**Good example:** "Maria pays $800 a month for insulin. She makes $2,400 a month.
The CEO of the company that makes her insulin made $23 million last year. He
testified to Congress that the price was necessary for 'innovation.' The company
spent more on stock buybacks than on R&D. Maria skips doses to make her supply
last. She shouldn't have to."

The structural analysis is the same. The story version moves people to action.

## 3.3 The Narrative Calendar

Successful narrative warfare is proactive, not reactive. Build a **narrative
calendar** that anticipates:

- **Earnings season:** When corporations report quarterly profits, be ready with
  comparisons (CEO pay vs. worker pay, profits vs. tax payments, stock buybacks
  vs. R&D investment).
- **Legislative cycles:** When relevant bills are moving, be ready with
  counter-narratives to corporate lobbying campaigns.
- **Seasonal moments:** Tax Day (who pays and who doesn't), Labor Day (actual
  labor conditions), Earth Day (actual environmental records).
- **Corporate events:** Shareholder meetings, product launches, industry
  conferences -- these are opportunities for counter-narrative actions.
- **Crisis moments:** When a corporation is caught doing something harmful (oil
  spill, data breach, price gouging), have rapid-response narrative teams ready
  to connect the specific incident to the systemic analysis.

# 4. POWER MAPPING IN PRACTICE

## 4.1 What Power Mapping Is

Power mapping is the practice of systematically identifying who has the power to
make the decision you want, what pressures and incentives they face, and how to
apply sufficient pressure to change their behavior.

The [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md) provides the data
infrastructure and intelligence architecture for mapping corporate power at
scale. This section provides the **methodology for using that infrastructure in a
specific campaign.**

## 4.2 The Campaign Power Map: Step by Step

### Step 1: Define Your Specific Demand

You cannot power-map "corporate greed." You can power-map "repeal the
non-compete clause in Amazon warehouse contracts" or "pass municipal broadband
in Austin, Texas" or "force Nestlé to stop extracting water from the Great
Lakes below market rate."

**The demand must be:**
- **Specific:** A concrete action that a specific decision-maker can take.
- **Measurable:** You can objectively determine whether it has been achieved.
- **Winnable:** It must be possible. (This doesn't mean easy. It means
  structurally possible.)
- **Meaningful:** It must actually improve people's lives.
- **Escalatable:** Winning this demand should build power for the next campaign.

### Step 2: Identify the Decision-Maker(s)

Who has the authority to grant your demand? This is often not who you think.

**Map the decision chain:**

```
Ultimate authority (e.g., CEO, Governor, Board of Directors)
    |
    v
Direct authority (e.g., VP of Operations, Committee Chair)
    |
    v
Implementation authority (e.g., regional manager, agency head)
    |
    v
Front-line authority (e.g., local manager, city council member)
```

For each level, identify:
- **Name and title**
- **What they care about** (re-election? bonus? reputation? career advancement?)
- **What they fear** (bad press? shareholder revolt? primary challenge? boycott?)
- **Who influences them** (donors? mentors? family? industry peers?)

### Step 3: Map the Influence Network

Around each decision-maker, map:

```
                  [Media covering them]
                        |
[Major donors] --- [DECISION-MAKER] --- [Industry peers]
                        |
               [Staff / advisors]
                        |
              [Constituents / customers]
```

For each influence node, assess:

- **Access:** Can you reach this person/entity?
- **Leverage:** Do they have something the decision-maker needs (money, votes,
  approval)?
- **Alignment:** Are they likely to support your demand? Oppose it? Be neutral?
- **Movability:** Can they be persuaded?

Use the [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md) data infrastructure to
trace connections: shared board memberships, campaign contributions, business
relationships, social ties.

### Step 4: Identify Pressure Points

Pressure points are places where a small amount of force produces
disproportionate results. Common pressure points:

- **Revenue vulnerabilities:** A company's largest customer. A government
  contract up for renewal. A consumer boycott of a high-margin product.
- **Reputation vulnerabilities:** An executive who cultivates a progressive image.
  A company that runs "values" marketing. A university with a public commitment
  to sustainability that invests its endowment in fossil fuels.
- **Legal vulnerabilities:** Regulatory compliance issues. Pending lawsuits.
  Whistleblower complaints.
- **Political vulnerabilities:** An elected official in a competitive district.
  A primary challenger. An upcoming election.
- **Internal vulnerabilities:** Worker organizing. Executive dissent. Board
  divisions.

### Step 5: Design the Campaign Strategy

With the map complete, design a strategy that applies **escalating pressure at
the most vulnerable points** until the decision-maker's cost of maintaining the
status quo exceeds the cost of granting your demand.

This is the core logic from [Historical Research](historical-research.md):
successful movements choose targets where the cost of repression exceeds the
cost of concession. Power mapping tells you exactly where that threshold is
lowest.

### Step 6: Run the Campaign and Update the Map

Power maps are living documents. As you campaign, you learn:

- Who are your unexpected allies?
- Who defected from where you expected them to be?
- What pressure worked? What didn't?
- What did you learn about the decision-maker's actual motivations?

Update the map continuously. What you learn in this campaign becomes
intelligence for the next one.

## 4.3 Power Mapping Example: Municipal Broadband Campaign

**Demand:** City of [X] should build and operate a municipal broadband network,
breaking the Comcast/AT&T duopoly.

**Decision-maker:** City Council (majority vote required).

**The map:**

| Council Member | Position | Pressure Point | Influence Network |
|---|---|---|---|
| Smith (Dist. 1) | Opposed | Took $15K from Comcast PAC | Small business coalition in district supports broadband |
| Jones (Dist. 2) | Supportive | Needs cover to vote yes | Teachers' union president is close friend |
| Lee (Dist. 3) | Undecided | Up for re-election | Senior constituents angry about internet prices |
| Garcia (Dist. 4) | Opposed | Ideologically anti-government | Libertarian but hates monopolies -- frame as competition |
| Williams (Dist. 5) | Supportive | Already committed | Can be champion -- give talking points and backup |

**Strategy:** You need 3 out of 5. Williams and Jones are yes. Target Lee
(electoral pressure from seniors) and Garcia (anti-monopoly frame). Smith is
the backup if Garcia is immovable.

**Tactics for Lee:** Organize senior constituent delegation. Pack town hall.
Collect petitions from district. Have seniors share stories about internet costs
on fixed incomes.

**Tactics for Garcia:** Frame as "breaking the monopoly" not "government
broadband." Find libertarian validators. Use data from cities where municipal
broadband increased competition and lowered prices.

This is how power mapping translates into specific, actionable campaign strategy.

## 4.4 Tools for Power Mapping

- **LittleSis** (littlesis.org): Free database of connections between powerful
  people and organizations. Tracks board memberships, donations, lobbying.
- **OpenSecrets** (opensecrets.org): Campaign finance and lobbying data.
- **SEC EDGAR** (sec.gov/edgar): Corporate filings, executive compensation,
  subsidiary structures.
- **State lobbying databases:** Most states have searchable lobbying
  registrations and expenditure reports.
- **LinkedIn:** The most underrated OSINT tool. Executive career paths,
  connections, board memberships.

# 5. THE ESCALATION LADDER

## 5.1 Why Escalation Matters

Most movements fail not because they lack passion or moral clarity but because
they don't know **when and how to escalate.** They either escalate too fast
(jumping to direct action without building base power first, alienating potential
supporters) or too slow (getting stuck in "awareness raising" forever while
nothing changes).

The escalation ladder is a framework for **sequencing tactics** so that each
step builds power for the next, maintains public legitimacy, and applies
increasing pressure on the target.

The [Game Theory](game-theory.md) document models this as an iterated game:
escalation is the process of changing the payoff matrix for the decision-maker.
Each rung of the ladder increases the cost of inaction to the target while
keeping the cost of concession constant.

## 5.2 The Seven Rungs

### Rung 1: Research and Analysis

**What:** Gather information. Map power. Understand the issue deeply. Identify
targets, allies, and pressure points.

**Tools:** The [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md) intelligence
infrastructure. Public records requests. Investigative journalism. OSINT
techniques from [Intelligence and OSINT](intelligence-and-osint.md).

**Duration:** Weeks to months.

**Who's involved:** Core team. Researchers. Data analysts.

**When to move up:** When you have a clear demand, a clear target, a clear
theory of change, and enough information to design a campaign.

### Rung 2: Public Education

**What:** Make the issue visible. Build public understanding. Create narrative
frames that resonate.

**Tools:** Reports. Infographics. Social media campaigns. Op-eds. Podcasts.
Public forums. The narrative warfare toolkit from
[Section 3](#3-narrative-warfare).

**Duration:** Weeks to months.

**Who's involved:** Communications team. Spokespeople. Affected community members.

**When to move up:** When there is measurable public awareness and concern, AND
the target has been given notice of the demand and declined to act.

### Rung 3: Organizing

**What:** Convert public concern into organized power. Recruit members. Build
chapters. Train leaders. Create infrastructure.

**Tools:** One-on-one conversations. House meetings. Training sessions. The
digital organizing stack from [Section 2](#2-digital-organizing-20). The
coalition architecture from [Section 1](#1-coalition-architecture).

**Duration:** Months.

**Who's involved:** Organizers. Community leaders. Volunteers.

**When to move up:** When you have enough organized people to credibly
demonstrate power AND you have given the target a clear opportunity to act.

### Rung 4: Demonstration of Power

**What:** Show the target (and the public) that you have organized power.
Rallies, marches, petition deliveries, public hearings, shareholder actions,
consumer boycotts.

**Tools:** Event logistics. Media coordination. Legal observers. The humor and
satire arsenal from [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md) for creative
actions that generate media coverage.

**Duration:** Days to weeks per action, sustained over months.

**Who's involved:** Broad membership. Allies. Coalition partners.

**When to move up:** When demonstrations of power have not produced concessions
AND you have maintained public legitimacy AND escalation will not alienate your
base.

### Rung 5: Direct Action

**What:** Disrupt the target's ability to operate normally. Sit-ins. Blockades.
Strikes. Work slowdowns. Supply chain disruptions. Shareholder revolts.

**This is where most movements get stuck or go wrong.** Direct action without
the preceding rungs is provocation. Direct action after the preceding rungs is
leverage.

**Tools:** Nonviolent direct action training. Legal support. Jail support.
De-escalation training. Media strategy (direct action generates coverage -- make
sure you control the narrative).

**Duration:** Days per action, sustained over weeks to months.

**Who's involved:** Trained, committed participants who understand and accept the
risks. Not everyone in the movement participates in direct action -- the movement
needs people at every rung simultaneously.

**When to move up:** When direct action has created sufficient leverage to
force negotiations or legislative action.

**Critical principle from [Historical Research](historical-research.md):** Direct
action works when the cost of repression (arresting hundreds of peaceful
protesters, breaking a picket line, evicting an encampment) exceeds the cost of
concession. If you cannot generate that cost ratio, you are not ready for this
rung.

### Rung 6: Policy Change

**What:** Convert leverage into formal policy change. Legislation. Regulation.
Court orders. Consent decrees. Corporate policy changes.

**Tools:** Lobbyists. Policy experts. Legislative allies. Legal teams. Model
legislation. Electoral strategy (primary challenges, voter registration,
candidate endorsements).

**Duration:** Months to years.

**Who's involved:** Policy team. Legislative allies. Legal team. Grassroots
pressure (continuing to demonstrate power to maintain leverage during
negotiations).

**When to move up:** When formal policy change is achieved but structural
conditions that enabled the original problem remain.

### Rung 7: Structural Change

**What:** Change the underlying systems so the problem cannot recur. Electoral
reform. Corporate governance reform. Media reform. Economic restructuring.

This is the hardest rung because it threatens the deepest interests. Most
movements never get here. The ones that do -- the labor movement winning the
NLRA, the civil rights movement winning the Voting Rights Act, the suffragettes
winning the 19th Amendment -- change history.

**Tools:** Constitutional amendments. Fundamental legislative reform. New
institutional design. The Ember Economy model from [Economics](economics.md)
as an alternative economic architecture. The mechanism design principles from
[Game Theory](game-theory.md) for building systems that resist re-capture.

**Duration:** Years to decades.

**Who's involved:** The full movement. Political allies at the highest levels.
Intellectual and cultural leaders. International solidarity.

## 5.3 The Escalation Principles

**Principle 1: Each rung earns the next.** You earn the right to escalate by
demonstrating that lower rungs have been tried in good faith. This maintains
public legitimacy. "We asked, we educated, we organized, we demonstrated, and
they still won't budge -- now we're disrupting" is a narrative that sustains
public support. "We showed up and broke stuff" is not.

**Principle 2: Multiple rungs simultaneously.** A mature movement operates on
multiple rungs at once. While direct action is happening at one target,
education is happening for a new audience, organizing is building in new
communities, and policy work is advancing in the legislature.

**Principle 3: De-escalation is not defeat.** Sometimes you de-escalate because
you've won a partial victory and want to consolidate. Sometimes because the
target has shown genuine willingness to negotiate. Sometimes because your
assessment was wrong and you need to regroup. Strategic retreat is part of
strategic advance.

**Principle 4: Escalation must be tied to demands.** Every escalation should be
accompanied by a clear demand and a clear path for the target to de-escalate
the conflict by meeting the demand. Escalation without an off-ramp is chaos,
not strategy.

**Principle 5: The target chooses the rung.** If the target meets the demand at
Rung 2, you never need Rung 5. If the target stonewalls through Rung 5, they
have chosen the escalation, not you. This is the framing that maintains public
legitimacy.

# 6. SECURITY CULTURE

## 6.1 The Threat Landscape

Movements that challenge concentrated power face surveillance, infiltration, and
repression. This is not paranoia. It is historically documented:

- **COINTELPRO** (FBI, 1956-1971): Systematic infiltration, disruption, and
  destruction of civil rights, anti-war, and Black liberation organizations.
  Tactics included forged letters, false arrests, media manipulation, and
  assassination.
- **Standing Rock** (2016-2017): TigerSwan, a private military contractor hired
  by Energy Transfer Partners (Dakota Access Pipeline), ran a counter-insurgency
  operation against peaceful water protectors, including infiltrators, aerial
  surveillance, and coordination with law enforcement.
- **UK Undercover Police** (1968-2010): British police officers spent years
  undercover in activist organizations, forming intimate relationships with
  activists as part of their cover, fathering children, and reporting on lawful
  political activity.
- **Corporate Espionage:** Chevron hired private investigators to surveil
  environmental activists. Walmart infiltrated worker organizing groups.
  Amazon monitored union activity through social media surveillance.

The current threat landscape includes:

- **Law enforcement surveillance:** Social media monitoring, IMSI catchers
  (Stingrays), facial recognition, license plate readers, geofence warrants.
- **Corporate surveillance:** Private investigators, social media monitoring,
  HR departments tracking employee organizing activity.
- **Digital surveillance:** Metadata collection (who you talk to, when, how
  often), location tracking via cell phones, browser fingerprinting.
- **Infiltration:** Undercover officers or corporate agents joining
  organizations to gather intelligence and sow discord.
- **Legal harassment:** SLAPP suits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
  Participation), injunctions, arrests on pretextual charges.

## 6.2 Threat Modeling

Not everyone faces the same threats. A parent attending a school board meeting
faces different risks than an organizer planning civil disobedience. Security
culture must be **proportionate to actual risk**, not maximum paranoia.

### The Threat Model Matrix

| Activity Level | Threat Sources | Key Risks | Security Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public supporter** (signs petitions, attends rallies) | Social media doxxing, employer retaliation | Reputation, employment | Basic |
| **Active organizer** (recruits, plans events) | Law enforcement monitoring, corporate surveillance | Arrest, legal harassment, doxxing | Moderate |
| **Direct action participant** (civil disobedience) | Arrest, prosecution, physical violence | Jail, injury, criminal record | High |
| **Legal/financial support** (bail funds, legal defense) | Financial surveillance, subpoenas | Financial exposure, legal liability | Moderate-High |
| **Whistleblower** (inside information from corporations) | Employer retaliation, prosecution (Espionage Act), surveillance | Career destruction, prosecution, physical danger | Maximum |
| **Journalist/researcher** (investigating corporate power) | Source burning, legal threats, surveillance | Source protection, physical safety | High |

### How to Threat Model

For each person or group, ask:

1. **What are you protecting?** (Your identity? Your communications? Your
   location? Your sources? Your membership list?)
2. **Who are you protecting it from?** (Local police? FBI? Corporate security?
   Random internet trolls?)
3. **What are the consequences of failure?** (Embarrassment? Job loss? Arrest?
   Physical danger?)
4. **How likely is the threat?** (Are you a high-profile target or a low-priority
   one?)
5. **What can you do about it?** (What security measures are feasible given
   your resources and technical skill?)

## 6.3 Practical Security Measures

### Basic Level (Everyone)

- **Social media hygiene:** Assume anything you post publicly is permanent and
  searchable. Use privacy settings. Don't post photos from actions that show
  identifiable faces without consent.
- **Password security:** Unique passwords for every account. Use a password
  manager (Bitwarden is free and open-source). Enable two-factor authentication
  (hardware key preferred, authenticator app acceptable, SMS is the worst option
  but better than nothing).
- **Phone security:** Keep your phone updated. Use a lock screen. Know your
  rights regarding phone searches at protests (in the US: police cannot compel
  you to unlock your phone with a passcode; they may be able to compel
  biometrics).
- **Right to remain silent:** Know it. Use it. "I am exercising my right to
  remain silent and I want to speak to a lawyer."

### Moderate Level (Organizers)

All of the above, plus:

- **Signal for all organizing communication.** Not SMS, not email, not Facebook
  Messenger. Signal with disappearing messages enabled.
- **Separate devices.** If possible, use a separate phone for organizing. A
  cheap prepaid phone bought with cash is a reasonable option.
- **Meeting security.** For sensitive meetings: no phones in the room (not just
  silenced -- physically in another room or in a Faraday bag). Take notes by hand,
  not on a laptop. Shred notes after decisions are recorded securely.
- **Compartmentalization.** Not everyone needs to know everything. Organize
  information on a need-to-know basis. This limits damage from infiltration.
- **Vetting.** New members in sensitive roles should be vouched for by existing
  trusted members. This is not paranoia; it is standard practice in any
  organization handling sensitive information.

### High Level (Direct Action, Whistleblowers)

All of the above, plus:

- **Tails OS** for sensitive digital work. Boots from a USB drive, routes all
  traffic through Tor, leaves no trace on the computer.
- **Air-gapped devices** for the most sensitive information. A computer that has
  never been connected to the internet.
- **Counter-surveillance awareness.** Know what surveillance looks like. Practice
  routes with surveillance detection runs. Vary your patterns.
- **Legal preparation.** Know your lawyer's number by heart (not saved in a phone
  that might be seized). Have a legal support team that knows to expect your
  call. Carry a legal rights card.
- **Arrest preparation.** If you're planning civil disobedience: remove
  identifying items, carry only essentials, write your lawyer's number on your
  arm in permanent marker, arrange childcare and pet care in advance, have a
  jail support team ready.

## 6.4 The Costs of Security Culture

This section is usually missing from security guides, so let's be honest about
it.

**Security culture has real costs:**

- **It slows things down.** Encrypted communication is harder than texting. Vetting
  new members takes time. Compartmentalization means fewer people have the full
  picture.
- **It can create paranoia.** The line between "healthy caution" and "seeing
  infiltrators everywhere" is blurry. Paranoia destroys the trust that movements
  depend on.
- **It can exclude.** People without technical skills, older members, people
  without smartphones -- security requirements can become barriers to
  participation.
- **It can become a power tool.** "I can't tell you that for security reasons"
  can be used to hoard information and consolidate control. This is a failure
  mode -- see [Section 10](#10-failure-modes).

**How to manage these costs:**

- **Proportionality.** Don't use maximum security for minimum-risk activities.
  The school board meeting doesn't need counter-surveillance.
- **Training.** Invest in making security tools accessible. Run workshops. Create
  guides in plain language.
- **Transparency about why.** When security measures are necessary, explain why.
  People accept inconvenience when they understand the reason.
- **Trust building.** Security culture works in a context of trust. Invest in
  the relationships (see [Section 2.3](#23-the-irl-digital-hybrid-model) on
  in-person trust building).

# 7. FUNDRAISING WITHOUT CAPTURE

## 7.1 The Fundamental Tension

Movements need money. Money comes from sources that have their own interests.
Those interests can distort the movement. This is the **fundraising capture
cycle:**

1. Movement needs resources.
2. Funder provides resources (with conditions, explicit or implicit).
3. Movement adjusts its priorities to maintain funding.
4. Movement's goals drift toward funder's goals.
5. Movement loses grassroots legitimacy.
6. Movement becomes a professional advocacy organization that serves its funders
   rather than its constituency.

This happened to the Tea Party (Koch brothers redirected populist energy toward
corporate-friendly policies). It happened to many environmental organizations
("Big Green" groups that won't criticize their corporate donors). It is an
ever-present danger.

The [Game Theory](game-theory.md) document analyzes this as a principal-agent
problem: the movement's constituency is the principal, but funders become
de facto principals through financial leverage.

## 7.2 Funding Models That Resist Capture

### Small-Dollar Fundraising

**The model:** Many small donations from many people, no single donor large enough
to exert influence.

**Examples:**
- Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns: average donation ~$27, millions of
  individual donors.
- ActBlue's infrastructure: enabled small-dollar fundraising at scale for
  progressive campaigns.
- Wikipedia: funded by small donations from millions of users.

**Why it resists capture:** No single donor has leverage. The "constituency" and
the "funders" are the same people.

**Requirements:** You need a large base of supporters who believe in the cause
enough to give money. This means the organizing work ([Section 1](#1-coalition-architecture))
must come first. You can't small-dollar fundraise your way to a movement; you
have to build the movement first.

**Practical tips:**
- Make donating easy (one-click, recurring options).
- Report back on how money was spent (transparency builds trust and future giving).
- Tie asks to specific campaigns and outcomes, not general operations.
- Thank donors personally (not just auto-emails).
- Never shame people for the amount they give or don't give.

### Mutual Aid

**The model:** Members directly supporting each other's material needs, bypassing
traditional funding structures entirely.

**Examples:**
- Black Panther Party survival programs (free breakfast, health clinics, schools).
- Mutual aid networks during COVID-19 (grocery delivery, rent assistance).
- India farmers' protest langars (community kitchens feeding thousands daily).

**Why it resists capture:** There's no external funder to capture the movement.
Resources flow within the community.

**The connection to the Ember Economy:** This is exactly the principle behind the
[Ember Economy](economics.md) model -- building economic structures that reduce
dependence on extractive systems. The Ember Economy's resource pooling mechanisms,
community currencies, and cooperative ownership models are mutual aid scaled up
and systematized.

### Cooperative Revenue

**The model:** The movement owns or operates revenue-generating enterprises whose
profits fund movement activities.

**Examples:**
- Mondragon Corporation (worker-owned cooperative federation in Spain, $12B+
  annual revenue).
- Movement for Black Lives' investments in cooperative enterprises.
- Historical examples: the NAACP funded itself partly through magazine
  subscriptions (The Crisis); labor unions funded themselves through dues.

**Why it resists capture:** The movement controls its own revenue source.

**Requirements:** Business acumen. Legal infrastructure (cooperative law varies
by jurisdiction). Initial capital. The [Ember Economy](economics.md) document's
cooperative ownership models provide the theoretical framework; implementation
requires operational expertise.

### Blended Model (Recommended)

No single funding model is sufficient. The recommended approach:

- **Base:** Small-dollar donations from the membership (aim for 60%+ of budget)
- **Supplement:** Mutual aid for direct member needs
- **Growth:** Cooperative enterprises for sustainable revenue
- **Tactical:** Grants from aligned foundations (with strict independence
  conditions -- see below)
- **Emergency:** Crowdfunding for specific urgent needs (legal defense, bail
  funds, disaster response)

### If You Take Foundation Money

Sometimes large grants are necessary (legal defense is expensive; technology
development requires investment). If you take foundation or large-donor money:

- **Written independence agreements.** The funder has no say over strategy,
  campaigns, targets, messaging, or leadership.
- **Diversification.** No single funder provides more than 15% of total budget.
- **Sunset provisions.** Foundation funding should decrease over time as
  small-dollar and cooperative revenue grows.
- **Transparency.** Publish your donor list (above a threshold) and your budget.
  Let your membership see who's funding what.
- **The "Would we do this without the money?" test.** Before accepting any
  funded project, ask: would we do this if we were funding it ourselves? If no,
  don't take the money.

# 8. LEADERSHIP MODELS

## 8.1 The Leadership Dilemma

Movements face a genuine dilemma:

- **Charismatic leadership** is effective at inspiring, communicating, and making
  quick decisions. But it creates single points of failure (arrest the leader,
  kill the movement), personality cults, and accountability vacuums.
- **Leaderless organization** prevents personality cults but makes strategic
  coordination nearly impossible, allows informal hierarchies to form
  (Jo Freeman's "Tyranny of Structurelessness"), and prevents anyone from being
  accountable for decisions.

Both extremes fail. The answer is **distributed leadership with clear
accountability.**

## 8.2 The Distributed Leadership Model

### Principles

**Distributed, not absent.** There are leaders. They just aren't permanent,
singular, or unaccountable.

**Role-based, not personality-based.** Authority is attached to roles (media
coordinator, action lead, finance manager), not people. Roles rotate.

**Accountable.** Leaders are accountable to the membership through clear
mechanisms (elections, recall, term limits, transparent reporting).

**Developed.** Leadership is a skill that is actively developed throughout the
organization, not a trait that a few people are born with.

### The Leadership Pipeline

A healthy movement continuously develops new leaders through a structured
pipeline:

```
New member
    |
    v
Active participant (attends events, volunteers for tasks)
    |
    v
Team leader (leads a working group, facilitates meetings)
    |
    v
Campaign coordinator (plans and executes a campaign)
    |
    v
Chapter leader (coordinates multiple campaigns, manages teams)
    |
    v
Regional/national coordinator (strategy, cross-chapter coordination)
    |
    v
Mentor / trainer (develops the next generation of leaders)
```

At each level:
- **Training:** Specific skills for the role (facilitation, strategy, media,
  finance, conflict resolution).
- **Mentorship:** Paired with someone who's been in the role.
- **Evaluation:** Regular feedback from peers and those they lead.
- **Rotation:** No one stays in any role indefinitely. Recommended: 1-2 year
  terms with possibility of one renewal.

### Handling Charismatic Individuals

Charismatic individuals are valuable. They are also dangerous. The key is to
channel charisma without creating dependence on it.

**Do:**
- Use charismatic individuals as spokespeople, not decision-makers.
- Ensure they always share platforms with other leaders.
- Give them a defined role with clear boundaries.
- Publicly credit the team, not the individual.
- Develop other compelling communicators.

**Don't:**
- Let one person become the "face" of the movement.
- Let media access concentrate in one person.
- Let fundraising depend on one person's star power.
- Let strategic decisions be made by whoever is most eloquent rather than
  whoever has the most information and experience.

**The 3-spokesperson rule:** For any major media opportunity, have at least 3
people who can fill the role. If only one person can do it, that is a
vulnerability, not an asset.

### Decision-Making Models

Different decisions require different models:

| Decision Type | Model | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Emergency tactical** | Command (designated leader decides) | "Police are approaching, which exit do we use?" |
| **Campaign strategy** | Representative (elected body deliberates) | "Should we escalate to direct action?" |
| **Organizational policy** | Democratic (membership votes) | "Should we endorse a political candidate?" |
| **Values/principles** | Consensus (near-universal agreement required) | "What are our core principles?" |
| **Day-to-day operations** | Delegated (role holders decide within mandate) | "What social media should we post today?" |

The mistake most movements make is using one model for all decisions (usually
either pure consensus, which paralyzes, or pure command, which alienates).

## 8.3 Preventing Organizational Capture

The [Game Theory](game-theory.md) document's mechanism design section provides
formal models for preventing power concentration. Here are the practical
implementations:

- **Term limits for all leadership roles.** No exceptions.
- **Financial transparency.** All spending above a threshold is published to
  membership.
- **Recall mechanisms.** Any leader can be recalled by a supermajority of their
  constituents.
- **Anti-accumulation rules.** No person holds more than one leadership role.
  No person serves consecutive terms in the same role.
- **Conflict of interest disclosure.** Leaders disclose employment, financial
  interests, and relationships that might create conflicts.
- **Independent audits.** Financial and organizational audits by trusted but
  independent parties.

# 9. MEASURING SUCCESS

## 9.1 The Vanity Metrics Problem

Most movements measure the wrong things:

- **Social media followers.** These correlate weakly with actual power. A million
  followers who don't show up, don't donate, don't call their representatives,
  and don't participate in actions are worth less than a thousand who do.
- **Attendance at rallies.** A large rally is exciting and generates media
  coverage, but attendance is a measure of energy, not power. Energy without
  organization dissipates.
- **Media mentions.** Coverage is valuable for narrative control, but "any
  publicity is good publicity" is a myth. Negative coverage that reinforces
  corporate frames is worse than no coverage.
- **Petition signatures.** Easy to get, easy to ignore. A petition is a
  broadcast tool, not a power tool.

These are **vanity metrics** -- they feel like progress without necessarily being
progress.

## 9.2 Power Shift Indicators

What should you actually measure? **Indicators that the balance of power is
shifting.**

### Organizational Power Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Active members** (not just subscribers) | People who take at least one action per month | Active members are deployable power |
| **Leadership development** | Number of new leaders trained and deployed | Organizational depth and resilience |
| **Geographic spread** | Number of active chapters / localities | Breadth of power base |
| **Cross-movement relationships** | Number of active solidarity partnerships | Coalition strength |
| **Rapid mobilization capacity** | How many people can you turn out in 48 hours? | Tactical readiness |
| **Retention rate** | % of members still active after 12 months | Sustainability |

### Campaign Power Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Demands met** | Percentage of campaign demands achieved | You're winning or you're not |
| **Target response** | Does the target acknowledge you? Negotiate? Concede? | They're worried or they're not |
| **Cost imposed on target** | Revenue lost, reputation damage, executive time consumed | Pressure is working or it's not |
| **Allies gained** | New organizations, officials, influencers supporting the cause | Power base is growing or it's not |
| **Opposition fragmentation** | Splits in the opposing coalition | Your framing is working or it's not |
| **Policy movement** | Bills introduced, hearings held, regulations proposed | The system is responding or it's not |

### Narrative Power Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Frame adoption** | Are media and public using your frame or the opponent's? | You're winning the story or you're not |
| **Overton window shift** | Are ideas that were "radical" becoming "mainstream"? | The terms of debate are shifting or they're not |
| **Counter-narrative penetration** | When the corporation speaks, does your counter-narrative appear in coverage? | Your narrative infrastructure is working or it's not |
| **Narrative initiative** | Are you setting the agenda or reacting to theirs? | You have narrative power or you don't |

### Structural Change Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Laws/regulations changed** | Formal policy changes achieved | Structural power is shifting |
| **Enforcement actions** | Are new rules being enforced? | Paper changes vs. real changes |
| **Institutional design** | New institutions created (cooperatives, community land trusts, municipal enterprises) | Building alternative power structures |
| **Corporate behavior change** | Not just PR -- actual changes in corporate practice | Real consequences for corporate actors |
| **Electoral power** | Movement-endorsed candidates elected; movement-opposed candidates defeated | Political system is responsive or it's not |

## 9.3 The Dashboard

A movement should maintain a simple dashboard that tracks its most important
metrics. Not all metrics -- the most important ones. For a given campaign, this
might be:

```
CAMPAIGN: Municipal Broadband in [City]
STATUS: Rung 4 (Demonstration of Power)

ORGANIZATIONAL
- Active members: 2,340 (+180 this month)
- Chapters: 8 across the city
- Rapid mobilization: ~400 in 48 hours (tested in Jan action)

CAMPAIGN
- Council votes: 2 committed, 1 leaning, 2 opposed
- Target response: Council member Lee agreed to a meeting
- Cost imposed: Comcast sent lobbyists to 3 council meetings (they're spending resources)

NARRATIVE
- Frame adoption: Local paper used "broadband monopoly" framing in 4/6 recent articles
- Overton window: Municipal broadband went from "fringe" to "debated" in 6 months

NEXT MILESTONES
- [ ] Turn out 500+ to March city council hearing
- [ ] Get Lee to commit publicly
- [ ] Launch small-business coalition endorsement
```

## 9.4 The Honest Assessment

Every quarter, the leadership should conduct an honest assessment:

1. **Are we building power or consuming energy?** (Are we growing, or are we
   running the same people ragged?)
2. **Is the target responding?** (If after 6 months of campaigning the target
   hasn't changed behavior at all, the strategy may need revision.)
3. **Are we winning the narrative?** (Are more people using our frame or
   the opponent's?)
4. **Is the coalition growing or shrinking?** (Are we adding allies or losing
   them?)
5. **Are we developing leaders or burning out leaders?** (See [Section 10.2](#102-burnout) on
   burnout.)
6. **Would we start this campaign again, knowing what we know now?** (The sunk
   cost fallacy applies to campaigns too.)

# 10. FAILURE MODES

## 10.1 Co-optation

**What it looks like:** The movement's language and aesthetics are adopted by the
very powers it opposes, emptying them of meaning. The movement's leaders are
absorbed into the system they sought to change. The movement's demands are
partially met in ways that relieve pressure without addressing root causes.

**Historical examples:**
- **Corporate "woke-washing":** Companies adopt social justice language while
  maintaining exploitative practices. Amazon celebrates Pride while fighting
  warehouse workers' right to organize. Banks post Black Lives Matter statements
  while maintaining lending discrimination.
- **Tea Party capture:** Genuine populist anger at bank bailouts was redirected
  by corporate-funded organizations toward deregulation and tax cuts for the
  wealthy -- policies that benefited the very banks the base was angry at.
- **NGO-ification:** Grassroots movements become professional nonprofits with
  paid staff, boards of directors, and grant-dependent budgets. The organization
  survives but the movement dies.

**Detection signals:**
- Corporate sponsors start approaching the movement.
- Leaders start getting job offers from the institutions they're challenging.
- The movement's demands get narrower and more "realistic" without strategic
  justification.
- Foundation funding comes with implicit expectations to "professionalize" and
  "moderate."
- The base starts saying "this doesn't feel like our movement anymore."

**Counter-strategies:**
- **Maintain structural independence.** The fundraising model from
  [Section 7](#7-fundraising-without-capture) is the primary defense.
- **Name it publicly.** When a corporation co-opts your language, call it out.
  This is where [humor and satire](humor-and-satire.md) excel -- the parody ad
  translating corporate "sustainability" claims into plain English.
- **Demand specificity.** Vague demands ("we want justice") are easy to co-opt.
  Specific demands ("pass this bill, by this date, with these provisions") are
  not.
- **Independent media.** If you control your own narrative channels, co-optation
  is harder. If you depend on corporate media to tell your story, co-optation is
  inevitable.

## 10.2 Burnout

**What it looks like:** Chronic exhaustion, cynicism, withdrawal. Key organizers
quit. The remaining members take on more work, accelerating their own burnout.
The movement contracts to a shrinking core of increasingly exhausted people.

**Why it happens:**
- **Urgency culture.** Everything is an emergency. There is no rest because the
  injustice doesn't rest.
- **Martyrdom norm.** Self-sacrifice is valued. Admitting exhaustion is seen as
  weakness or insufficient commitment.
- **Structural overwork.** Too few people doing too much work because
  organizational infrastructure is inadequate.
- **Emotional weight.** Spending every day immersed in injustice, trauma,
  and opposition takes a real psychological toll.
- **Lack of wins.** Sustained effort without visible progress is demoralizing.

**Detection signals:**
- Key people stop showing up or become chronically late.
- Communication becomes terse, irritable, or passive-aggressive.
- Meetings become complaints about workload rather than strategic discussions.
- New ideas are met with "we don't have capacity" regardless of merit.
- People who leave are described as "not committed enough" rather than "burned
  out by an unsustainable pace."

**Counter-strategies:**
- **Build in rest.** Sabbatical policies for leaders. Seasonal cycles with
  planned low-activity periods. "No organizing" days.
- **Distribute the load.** If your movement depends on a few people doing
  everything, your leadership pipeline ([Section 8.2](#82-the-distributed-leadership-model))
  is failing.
- **Celebrate wins.** Even small ones. The narrative that nothing ever changes
  is a burnout accelerant and it's usually not true.
- **Normalize boundaries.** "I can't take this on right now" is a healthy
  statement, not a betrayal. Leaders who model boundaries give everyone
  permission to have them.
- **Create sustainable pace.** A movement that burns out its people in two years
  is not a movement. It is a tantrum. Real change takes decades. Pace accordingly.

## 10.3 Repression

**What it looks like:** State or corporate power uses force, legal action, or
surveillance to disrupt, disable, or destroy the movement.

**Forms of repression:**
- **Hard repression:** Arrests, prosecution, physical violence, imprisonment.
- **Soft repression:** Permit denials, zoning restrictions, defamation,
  employment retaliation, social media bans.
- **Legal repression:** SLAPP suits, injunctions, anti-protest legislation
  (there has been a dramatic increase in US state-level anti-protest laws since
  2016).
- **Digital repression:** Platform bans, account suspensions, content removal,
  algorithmic suppression.

**Detection signals:**
- Sudden increase in law enforcement interest (presence at events, inquiries
  to members, subpoenas).
- Legal threats from corporate targets.
- Doxxing of members or leaders.
- Media smear campaigns.
- Infiltrators exposed or suspected.

**Counter-strategies:**
- **Legal infrastructure.** Relationships with civil liberties organizations (ACLU,
  NLG, local legal aid). Trained legal observers at every action. Know-your-rights
  training for all members.
- **Documentation.** Document everything. Video. Photographs. Contemporaneous
  notes. Documentation is both legal defense and public narrative.
- **Security culture.** See [Section 6](#6-security-culture). Proportionate to
  the actual threat level.
- **Solidarity networks.** When one movement is repressed, others show up. Build
  these relationships before you need them.
- **Narrative preparation.** Repression is a narrative opportunity. "They're
  arresting people for peacefully protesting" is a powerful story -- if you've
  maintained nonviolent discipline and documented everything.
- **The backfire effect.** Repression that is perceived as unjust can strengthen
  a movement. The Birmingham police dogs, the Standing Rock water cannons, the
  Bloody Sunday bridge -- these moments of repression backfired spectacularly
  because they made the injustice visible. But this only works when the movement
  has maintained moral authority. If the movement has been violent or undisciplined,
  repression is perceived as justified and does not backfire.

## 10.4 Internal Conflict

**What it looks like:** The movement tears itself apart from the inside.
Factional disputes. Interpersonal conflicts elevated to organizational crises.
Ideological purity tests. Accusations and counter-accusations.

**Why it happens:**
- **Unresolved power dynamics.** Informal hierarchies (based on charisma,
  seniority, social capital) clash with formal structures.
- **Ideological disputes.** Disagreements about tactics, strategy, or goals that
  become identity issues rather than strategic discussions.
- **Interpersonal conflicts.** In a high-stress environment, personal conflicts
  become amplified and political.
- **Infiltration.** Agents provocateurs intentionally sow discord (this is a
  documented COINTELPRO tactic).
- **Purity spiraling.** Progressive movements are particularly vulnerable to
  cycles of increasingly extreme purity tests that exclude allies and consume
  internal energy.

**Detection signals:**
- Meetings become dominated by internal grievances rather than external strategy.
- Factions form around personalities rather than strategic positions.
- Social media conflicts between members become public.
- More energy is spent on internal accountability processes than on campaigns.
- "Calling out" replaces "calling in" as the default mode of addressing
  disagreements.

**Counter-strategies:**
- **Formal conflict resolution processes.** Mediation. Restorative justice
  circles. Not everything needs to be resolved in a public meeting.
- **Clear decision-making structures.** When it's clear how decisions are made,
  there's less room for destructive power struggles. See
  [Section 8.2](#82-the-distributed-leadership-model).
- **Strategic framing of disagreements.** "We disagree about tactics" is healthy.
  "You're a bad person" is not. Leaders must model the former.
- **The 80/20 rule.** If you agree on 80% of things, you're allies. Focus on what
  you share, not what divides you. Save the 20% for after you've won.
- **External focus.** The best cure for internal conflict is a compelling external
  campaign. When people are focused on winning against an external opponent,
  internal disputes shrink.

## 10.5 Mission Drift

**What it looks like:** The movement gradually shifts from its original purpose to
something else -- usually something safer, more fundable, or more aligned with
its leaders' personal interests.

**Common drift patterns:**
- **From movement to organization.** The movement becomes a self-perpetuating
  nonprofit whose primary goal is organizational survival rather than its
  original mission.
- **From systemic change to service delivery.** Instead of changing the systems
  that create poverty, the organization runs a food bank. The food bank is
  needed. But it's not the mission.
- **From broad coalition to ideological club.** The movement narrows its focus to
  satisfy its most ideologically committed members, losing the broad base that
  gave it power.
- **From external challenge to internal process.** The movement becomes consumed
  by its own governance, its own identity, its own internal dynamics.

**Detection signals:**
- The original specific demands become vague "ongoing work."
- Board meetings spend more time on organizational maintenance than on strategy.
- New members are confused about what the movement actually does.
- The organization's public communications are about itself rather than about
  the issues.
- Long-time members can't articulate a clear theory of how the organization's
  current activities lead to its stated goals.

**Counter-strategies:**
- **Sunset clauses.** Some organizations should be designed to end when their
  purpose is achieved or when they've failed to achieve it.
- **Regular mission audits.** Every year, ask: does what we're doing actually
  advance our stated mission? If not, change what we're doing or change the
  mission statement (honestly).
- **Grassroots accountability.** The membership -- not the staff, not the board --
  should set the strategic direction. This is the principal-agent alignment
  problem from [Game Theory](game-theory.md).
- **Track the metrics that matter.** The metrics from
  [Section 9](#9-measuring-success) should be tied to the original mission, not
  to organizational vanity metrics.

# 11. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: THE CAMPAIGN BLUEPRINT

## 11.1 From Theory to Practice

The preceding ten sections are tools. This section is the workbench where they
come together. Here is a step-by-step blueprint for launching a campaign against
corporate capture, integrating all the frameworks in this document and the
broader Cleansing Fire research.

### Phase 1: Intelligence (Weeks 1-4)

1. **Identify the issue** through community listening (not by deciding what people
   should care about).
2. **Research the power structure** using the methodology from
   [Section 4](#4-power-mapping-in-practice) and the data infrastructure from
   [Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md).
3. **Formulate a specific demand** that is winnable, meaningful, and escalatable.
4. **Identify allies and opponents** in the influence network.
5. **Assess the threat environment** using the threat model from
   [Section 6.2](#62-threat-modeling).

### Phase 2: Foundation (Weeks 4-12)

1. **Build the core team** through one-on-one organizing conversations
   ([Section 2.3](#23-the-irl-digital-hybrid-model)).
2. **Establish the communication stack** ([Section 2.2](#22-the-communication-stack)).
3. **Develop the narrative** using frame analysis and strategic storytelling
   ([Section 3](#3-narrative-warfare)).
4. **Set up the organizational structure** with distributed leadership
   ([Section 8](#8-leadership-models)).
5. **Establish the funding base** using the blended model from
   [Section 7.2](#72-funding-models-that-resist-capture).
6. **Connect with allied movements** (cross-movement solidarity,
   [Section 1.3](#13-the-coalition-architecture-framework)).

### Phase 3: Public Launch (Week 12+)

1. **Begin public education campaign** (Escalation Rung 2,
   [Section 5.2](#52-the-seven-rungs)).
2. **Deploy counter-narratives** to corporate framing.
3. **Build public pressure** through demonstrations of power (Rung 4).
4. **Use humor and satire** for narrative actions that generate media coverage
   (see [Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md)).
5. **Escalate as appropriate** following the escalation principles from
   [Section 5.3](#53-the-escalation-principles).
6. **Measure and adapt** using the metrics from [Section 9](#9-measuring-success).

### Phase 4: Negotiate or Escalate (Ongoing)

1. **If the target engages:** Negotiate from strength. Don't accept partial
   victories that relieve pressure without achieving the demand. Keep organized
   power activated as leverage.
2. **If the target stonewalls:** Escalate to the next rung. Ensure public
   understands that the target chose escalation by refusing to respond.
3. **If the target retaliates:** Activate legal defense, security culture, and
   solidarity networks. Document everything. Use backfire dynamics.

### Phase 5: Win and Consolidate (Post-Victory)

1. **Enforce the win.** Policy change without enforcement is meaningless. Build
   monitoring capacity.
2. **Tell the story.** A victory narrative inspires future campaigns and recruits
   new members.
3. **Develop new leaders** from this campaign for the next one.
4. **Connect to the next campaign.** Each win should build toward the next
   structural change.
5. **Assess what worked and what didn't.** Honest after-action review.

## 11.2 The Long Game

Individual campaigns are battles. The war is structural change -- shifting the
balance of power from concentrated corporate control to distributed democratic
governance.

This requires thinking in decades, not news cycles. The Powell Memo was written
in 1971. It took 40 years for the corporate power it envisioned to fully
mature. Reversing it will not happen in a single campaign or a single election.

The Cleansing Fire framework is designed for this long game:

- **The Ember Economy** ([Economics](economics.md)) provides the alternative
  economic vision -- what we're building toward, not just what we're fighting
  against.
- **The Game Theory** ([Game Theory](game-theory.md)) provides the mechanism
  design principles for building institutions that resist re-capture.
- **The Corporate Power Map** ([Corporate Power Map](corporate-power-map.md))
  provides the intelligence infrastructure to understand what we're fighting.
- **The Historical Research** ([Historical Research](historical-research.md))
  provides the pattern recognition to avoid repeating mistakes.
- **The Humor and Satire** ([Humor and Satire](humor-and-satire.md)) provides the
  narrative weapons to puncture corporate mythology.
- **This Document** provides the organizational strategy to turn all of those
  into deployed, sustained, accountable power.

The fire does not need to consume everything. It needs to clear the dead wood
so new growth can emerge. That is the cleansing fire.

# APPENDIX C: GLOSSARY

**Astroturfing:** Manufacturing the appearance of grassroots support. Named because it looks like grass but is fake.

**Backfire effect (movement context):** When repression against a movement increases public sympathy for the movement, creating a net gain for the movement.

**Co-optation:** When a movement's language, symbols, or leaders are absorbed by the system they were challenging, neutralizing the threat.

**Escalation ladder:** A structured sequence of increasingly disruptive tactics, where each level earns the legitimacy for the next.

**Frame analysis:** The practice of identifying the unstated assumptions underlying any communication, and constructing alternative frames.

**Mission drift:** The gradual shift of an organization's actual activities away from its stated purpose.

**NGO-ification:** The transformation of a grassroots movement into a professional nonprofit, often at the cost of its radical potential.

**Power mapping:** The systematic identification of who has the power to grant a specific demand, what pressures they face, and how to apply sufficient pressure to change their behavior.

**Purity spiraling:** Increasingly extreme ideological purity tests that progressively exclude allies and consume internal energy.

**SLAPP suit:** Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation -- a legal action designed to silence critics through the cost of legal defense, not the merits of the case.

**Tyranny of Structurelessness:** Jo Freeman's concept describing how organizations that reject formal structure develop informal hierarchies that are less accountable than formal ones.
