## PREAMBLE: WHY ANOTHER ECONOMICS

Every economic system in history has been designed -- or has emerged -- to answer a single
question: **who gets what, and by what mechanism?** The answers have varied. Feudalism
answered: those who hold the land, by birthright. Capitalism answered: those who hold
capital, by market competition. State socialism answered: those whom the party designates,
by central plan. Each system told a story about why its answer was natural, inevitable, or
just. Each story was, at minimum, incomplete.

Pyrrhic Lucidity begins from a different question entirely: **what structural conditions
make it possible for an economy to serve the composite self -- the self that is not
sovereign but not nothing, not autonomous but not a puppet -- without concentrating
informational or material power beyond the point where genuine agency becomes impossible?**

This is not a reform proposal. Reform assumes the existing chassis is sound and needs
better parts. This is an invention -- a new economic architecture built from the
foundations up, drawing on the deepest available knowledge of how human beings actually
behave in groups, how resources have actually been managed across history, and how
information actually flows through complex systems.

The name is precise. "Ember" because this economy runs on the same principle as the
Cleansing Fire itself: the controlled, cyclical burning away of accumulated dead wood --
not to destroy, but to restore the conditions for new growth. Embers are what remain after
a fire: they are hot, alive, and capable of reigniting. They are not the blaze; they are
the persistent capacity for transformation. An ember economy is one in which value does
not accumulate into inert stockpiles but circulates, decays, and regenerates -- like
nutrients in a forest floor, like energy in an ecosystem, like information in a healthy
network.

This document is long because the problem is hard. Economic systems fail not because their
designers lacked good intentions but because they lacked structural imagination -- they
could not see past the categories their own training had installed. We will try to see
further, knowing that we too are embedded, that our categories are contaminated, and that
the model we build will need revision. That is a feature.

## PART I: THE FOUNDATIONS -- WHAT WE KNOW

### 1. The Myth of Barter and the Reality of Debt

Standard economics textbooks tell a creation story: first there was barter (I'll trade you
three chickens for a goat), then money emerged as a more efficient medium of exchange, then
credit developed as an abstraction of money. This story is false. David Graeber, drawing
on decades of anthropological evidence, demonstrated that **no society based primarily on
barter has ever been observed.** The sequence was invented by Adam Smith as a thought
experiment and has been repeated as established fact for 250 years.

What anthropology actually shows is that human economies began with **credit and
obligation** -- informal, interpersonal systems of "I owe you" embedded in thick social
relationships. Money did not emerge to make barter more efficient; it emerged, often
through state violence, to make debts precise, quantifiable, and enforceable by third
parties. The formalization of debt -- the transformation of "I owe you a favor" into "you
owe me exactly 47 units" -- was not a natural evolution. It was a political act, typically
imposed by states that needed to pay soldiers and collect taxes.

This matters because it demolishes the foundational assumption of mainstream economics:
that the economy is fundamentally a system of exchange between autonomous individuals
pursuing self-interest. The evidence says the economy is fundamentally a **system of
obligations between embedded persons pursuing survival, status, and meaning within
relationships they did not fully choose.** Self-interest is real, but it is not
foundational; it is one strategy among many, and it dominates only under specific
institutional conditions -- conditions that are themselves the product of deliberate
design, not natural law.

**Design implication:** An honest economics begins not from exchange but from obligation.
Not from the question "what do I want?" but from the question "what do I owe, to whom,
and under what conditions was that obligation formed?"

### 2. Baseline Communism and the Three Moral Logics

Graeber identified what he called **"baseline communism"** -- the principle that within
any functioning human group, people operate by the rule "from each according to their
abilities, to each according to their needs" for a wide range of everyday interactions.
You do not charge your coworker for the time you spend explaining a concept. You do not
invoice your neighbor for helping carry groceries. You do not bill your family for
emotional labor (though perhaps you should keep better accounts).

This is not ideological communism. It is the empirically observable substrate of all
human sociability. It coexists, in every known society, with two other moral logics:

- **Exchange:** the logic of equivalence, of quid pro quo, of "we're even." This logic
  governs relations between people who are not intimately connected but are approximate
  equals. It implies that the relationship could end -- that either party could walk away
  without residual obligation.

- **Hierarchy:** the logic of precedent, custom, and asymmetric obligation. The lord
  provides protection; the serf provides labor. The patron provides resources; the client
  provides loyalty. These are not "exchanges" because the parties are not equals and the
  relationship cannot be exited without violence.

Every economy is a configuration of these three logics. The question is not which logic
to impose universally (utopian error) but **how to design institutions that expand the
domain of baseline communism, constrain the domain of hierarchy, and keep the domain of
exchange honest.**

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy does not attempt to eliminate exchange or
hierarchy. It structures them so that they cannot metastasize -- so that exchange cannot
colonize the domain where baseline communism should operate (health, shelter, sustenance,
knowledge), and hierarchy cannot become self-perpetuating.

### 3. The Commons Are Governable

For decades, the dominant story in economics was Garrett Hardin's "tragedy of the
commons" -- the claim that shared resources are inevitably degraded because rational
individuals will always overexploit them. This story was used to justify both
privatization (give the commons to owners who will protect their investment) and
nationalization (give the commons to a state that will regulate use).

Elinor Ostrom spent her career demolishing this story. Studying more than 800 cases of
commons governance worldwide -- fisheries, forests, irrigation systems, pastures -- she
demonstrated that communities regularly manage shared resources successfully, often for
centuries, **without either privatization or state control.** She identified eight design
principles that characterize successful commons governance:

1. **Clear boundaries** -- who has rights to the resource and what those boundaries are
2. **Proportional costs and benefits** -- those who use more contribute more
3. **Collective decision-making** -- users participate in setting rules
4. **Effective monitoring** -- by monitors who are accountable to the community
5. **Graduated sanctions** -- responses to violations escalate proportionally
6. **Accessible conflict resolution** -- cheap, fast, informal dispute mechanisms
7. **Local autonomy** -- the right of communities to self-organize without
   external interference
8. **Nested governance** -- for resources that span multiple communities,
   appropriately layered institutional structures

Ostrom's work is devastating to both libertarian and statist economics because it
demonstrates that the binary of "market or state" is false. There is a third option --
**the commons, governed by the community of users through transparent, participatory,
self-enforcing rules** -- and it works better than either alternative for a wide range
of resources.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy is built on Ostrom's principles. Every resource
domain has its own governance structure, designed by and accountable to its users,
operating through transparent rules with graduated enforcement.

### 4. Money as Ecosystem, Not Monoculture

Bernard Lietaer, who helped design the convergence mechanism for the Euro, spent the
latter part of his career arguing that the Euro's design was fundamentally flawed -- not
in its details but in its monoculture logic. The modern monetary system, he argued, is
like an agricultural system that plants only one crop: maximally efficient in good times,
catastrophically fragile when conditions change.

Lietaer's key insight: **monetary systems, like ecosystems, require diversity to be
resilient.** A single national currency, managed by a single central bank, optimized for
a single metric (GDP growth or inflation targeting), is structurally brittle. When it
fails, everything fails simultaneously.

The alternative is a **monetary ecosystem** -- multiple currencies operating at different
scales, serving different functions, with different properties. The Swiss WIR Bank,
founded in 1934, is proof of concept: a complementary business-to-business currency that
operates alongside the Swiss franc. Multiple macroeconomic studies have demonstrated that
the WIR system is spontaneously counter-cyclical -- when the conventional economy
contracts, WIR activity expands, cushioning the blow. The Swiss economy's unusual
stability is partially attributable to this monetary biodiversity.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy does not have "a currency." It has a currency
ecology -- multiple media of exchange and obligation-tracking, operating at different
scales and serving different functions, with the diversity itself being a structural
feature rather than a bug.

### 5. Demurrage: Money That Knows It Should Move

Silvio Gesell, writing in 1916, identified a fundamental asymmetry in conventional money:
goods decay but money does not. A farmer's wheat rots. A carpenter's lumber warps. A
worker's labor-capacity expires at the end of each day. But the money-holder's money sits
in a vault, losing nothing, while the world around it degrades. This asymmetry gives the
money-holder a structural advantage -- they can always wait, while everyone else cannot.
This is the origin of interest: the money-holder charges for the privilege of releasing
money that they have no cost to holding.

Gesell's solution was **demurrage** -- money that depreciates over time, like all other
goods. You must spend it or invest it, because holding it costs you. The effect is to
reverse the structural advantage of the hoarder: instead of being rewarded for sitting on
capital, you are penalized. Money becomes a hot potato -- not something to accumulate but
something to circulate.

The Worgl experiment of 1932 demonstrated that this works. A small Austrian town, during
the Great Depression, issued its own stamp scrip -- currency that lost 1% of its value per
month unless a stamp was purchased and affixed. The result was an explosion of economic
activity: unemployment dropped, public works were completed, tax revenues increased. The
velocity of money -- the rate at which each unit changed hands -- was approximately
fourteen times that of the conventional Austrian schilling. The experiment was so
successful that it threatened the central bank's monopoly, and was forcibly terminated.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy uses demurrage as its primary anti-accumulation
mechanism. Value is designed to flow, not to pool. Holding is expensive; circulating is
free. This is not a tax on wealth -- it is a design feature of the medium itself, like
the half-life of a radioactive element. You cannot repeal it any more than you can repeal
entropy.

### 6. The Doughnut: Floors and Ceilings

Kate Raworth's doughnut economics provides the moral geometry the Ember Economy needs:
there is a **floor** below which no human being should fall (the social foundation --
food, water, health, education, political voice, social equity, gender equality, housing,
networks, energy, jobs, income) and a **ceiling** above which no economy should push (the
ecological ceiling -- climate change, ocean acidification, chemical pollution, nitrogen
and phosphorus loading, freshwater withdrawal, land conversion, biodiversity loss,
ozone layer depletion, air pollution).

Between the floor and the ceiling lies the **safe and just space for humanity** -- the
doughnut itself. An economy is successful not when it grows but when it brings everyone
into the doughnut and keeps them there.

This is directly incompatible with GDP as a metric. GDP measures throughput -- the total
volume of transactions -- without distinguishing between transactions that bring people
into the doughnut (feeding the hungry) and transactions that push the economy past its
ceiling (strip-mining a rainforest). An economy can have spectacular GDP growth while
simultaneously failing on both the floor and the ceiling.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy measures success by coverage -- what percentage
of participants are within the doughnut? -- not by throughput. Growth is not a goal; it
is sometimes a symptom of an economy moving in the right direction, and sometimes a
symptom of one moving in the wrong direction. The metric itself cannot tell you which.

### 7. Appropriate Scale and Buddhist Economics

E.F. Schumacher, advising the Burmese government in 1955, asked a question that
mainstream economics considers nonsensical: **what would an economy look like if it
took seriously the idea that people need good work?** Not just any employment, but work
that develops human capacities, connects people to their communities, and produces goods
that genuinely serve human needs rather than manufactured wants.

His answer -- "Buddhist economics" -- was not a mystical program but a pragmatic
reorientation. An economy organized around "enoughness" rather than "moreness." Technology
that is "appropriate" -- meaning scaled to the community it serves, comprehensible to its
users, and repairable with local skills and materials. Production that minimizes suffering
(of workers, of ecosystems, of future generations) rather than maximizing output.

Schumacher's insight, which complexity economics would later confirm empirically, is that
**efficiency and resilience are in tension.** A maximally efficient system -- one that has
eliminated all redundancy, all slack, all "waste" -- is maximally fragile. It has no
reserves, no buffers, no capacity to absorb shocks. The most resilient systems are
moderately efficient and highly redundant -- like ecosystems, like the internet, like the
human body.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy optimizes for resilience, not efficiency. It
tolerates redundancy. It values appropriate technology over cutting-edge technology. It
prefers systems that work at village scale and can be federated upward over systems that
work only at planetary scale and must be imposed downward.

### 8. The Lessons of Complexity

W. Brian Arthur and the Santa Fe Institute demonstrated that economies are not equilibrium
systems (as mainstream economics assumes) but **complex adaptive systems** -- systems in
which agents constantly adapt to the patterns they collectively create, generating
emergent behavior that no agent intended or controls.

This has three critical implications:

**Path dependence:** Small early advantages can lock an economy into trajectories that
persist long after the original advantage has disappeared. This is why "the market will
sort it out" is not a serious response to structural inequality -- markets do not
automatically correct path-dependent lock-in. They amplify it through increasing returns.

**Emergence:** Macro-level patterns (business cycles, inequality trends, technological
transitions) are not the sum of individual choices. They are emergent properties of
interaction patterns. You cannot understand an economy by studying individuals; you must
study the relationships.

**Non-linearity:** Small interventions can have large effects, and large interventions
can have no effect. The leverage points in a complex system are not where you expect them.
Donella Meadows identified the highest leverage point as **the paradigm out of which the
system arises** -- the set of shared assumptions that govern what counts as a "good"
economic outcome. Changing the paradigm changes everything downstream.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy is designed as a complex adaptive system, not
as a machine. It does not attempt to specify outcomes; it specifies the rules of
interaction and allows outcomes to emerge. It builds in feedback loops that allow
self-correction. It treats path dependence as a design hazard to be actively countered
through structural resets.

### 9. Information Asymmetry as the Substrate of Economic Power

Pyrrhic Lucidity holds that information asymmetry is the substrate of power in complex
societies. This principle has precise economic implications that mainstream economics has
partially recognized (Akerlof's "Market for Lemons," Stiglitz's work on screening and
signaling, mechanism design theory) but has systematically failed to follow to its
conclusion.

The conclusion is: **most of what we call "profit" in the contemporary economy is
information rent** -- returns that accrue not from producing genuine value but from
exploiting the gap between what the producer knows and what the consumer, worker, or
regulator knows. The pharmaceutical company that charges $1,000 for a drug that costs $5
to manufacture is not earning a return on innovation; it is earning a return on the
information asymmetry between its knowledge of production costs and the patient's
knowledge of alternatives. The tech platform that sells user data is not providing a
service; it is monetizing the information asymmetry between what it knows about users
and what users know about how their data is used.

This is not "market failure" in the conventional sense -- a deviation from an otherwise
healthy system. It is the **normal operation** of markets in which information is
asymmetrically distributed. Markets do not, and cannot, correct information asymmetries
that are the source of the profits that fund the lobbying that prevents the corrections.

**Design implication:** The Ember Economy treats information asymmetry not as a market
imperfection but as the primary form of economic extraction. Its institutions are designed
to minimize information rents by maximizing transparency -- not as a moral aspiration but
as a structural feature built into the protocols of exchange.

### 10. What Actually Works: Historical Evidence

Theory is necessary but not sufficient. We must also attend to what has actually been
tried and what has actually worked:

**Mondragon Cooperatives (Basque Country, Spain):** Founded in 1956, now comprising 98
cooperatives with over 80,000 worker-owners. Demonstrates that democratic governance is
compatible with competitive economic performance. One person, one vote. Maximum wage
ratios (originally 3:1, now approximately 6:1). During the 2008 financial crisis, areas
around Mondragon remained relatively stable while the rest of Spain suffered severe
unemployment. Over 85% of workers are cooperative members.

**Kerala Model (India):** Despite per-capita income far below developed-world levels,
Kerala achieved human development indicators comparable to those of Europe -- high
literacy, high life expectancy, low infant mortality, high political participation --
through investment in public health, public education, and decentralized governance.
In 1996, Kerala decentralized 35-40% of the state budget to local self-governments
through the "People's Campaign for Decentralized Planning." The state has 11,892
cooperatives across key sectors, with about 17% of India's cooperative membership
despite having less than 3% of the population.

**Emilia-Romagna (Italy):** A region of 4.5 million people where cooperatives produce
approximately 30% of GDP and two out of three inhabitants are cooperative members.
Demonstrates the viability of networked small-firm economies based on "flexible
specialization" -- cooperative networks of small, highly skilled enterprises that
can collectively compete with large corporations while maintaining democratic governance
and human-scale working conditions.

**The WIR Bank (Switzerland):** Operating since 1934, demonstrating that complementary
currencies can function stably for nearly a century, providing counter-cyclical economic
stability alongside a conventional national currency.

**Indigenous Governance Systems:** The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Great Law of Peace,
possibly the world's longest-running democratic constitution (founded c. 1142), governed
a confederacy of nations through principles of consensus, reciprocity, and the structural
redistribution of wealth. The potlatch system of Pacific Northwest peoples functioned as
a combined insurance system, banking system, property rights regime, and social safety net
-- all without formal markets or currency.

**Design implication:** Every element of the Ember Economy has precedent. Nothing proposed
here requires untested assumptions about human nature. What is new is the synthesis --
the combination of proven elements into a coherent architecture designed for the specific
challenges of the present moment.

## PART II: THE MODEL

### The Ember Economy: Overview

The Ember Economy is a polycentric, multi-currency, commons-based economic system with
built-in structural decay of accumulated power. It is designed to operate without central
authority, to prevent excessive wealth concentration through mechanism design rather than
redistributive taxation, and to function at scales from a neighborhood to a planetary
federation.

Its core innovation is the **Burn Cycle** -- a periodic, automatic, structurally embedded
redistribution mechanism modeled on ecological succession, historical jubilee traditions,
and network protocol design. The Burn Cycle is not a policy that can be repealed by those
who have accumulated power; it is a property of the economic medium itself, as fundamental
as the half-life of a radioactive isotope.

The model has six interlocking systems:

1. **The Currency Ecology** -- multiple media of exchange with different properties
2. **The Commons Protocol** -- governance of shared resources through Ostrom-derived rules
3. **The Production Mesh** -- cooperative, federated production organized through networks
4. **The Burn Cycle** -- automatic, periodic decay and redistribution of accumulated value
5. **The Transparency Lattice** -- information architecture that minimizes extraction
   through information asymmetry
6. **The Scale Stack** -- nested governance from household to planet

---

### System 1: The Currency Ecology

The Ember Economy does not have a single currency. It has a **currency ecology** --
multiple media of exchange operating at different scales, with different properties,
serving different functions. This is not a design flaw; it is the primary resilience
mechanism. Just as an ecosystem with many species is more resilient than a monoculture,
a monetary ecosystem with many currencies is more resilient than one dependent on a single
medium of exchange.

#### 1.1 Hearthmoney (Local Exchange)

**Scale:** Neighborhood to municipality (approximately 500-50,000 people)

**Properties:**
- Issued by local assemblies (not a central bank)
- **Demurrage rate: 1% per month** (12% annual depreciation)
- Denominated in labor-hours (one unit = one hour of unskilled labor, with multipliers
  capped at 3x for specialized skills)
- Cannot be converted to other currencies at rates that allow accumulation
- Used for local goods, services, and mutual aid

**Mechanism:** Hearthmoney is created when a member of a local assembly registers a
commitment to provide a service or produce a good. It is extinguished when the good or
service is delivered. The demurrage ensures that Hearthmoney circulates rapidly -- it is
more expensive to hold than to spend. This eliminates hoarding at the local level and
ensures that the medium of exchange serves exchange rather than accumulation.

**Precedent:** The Worgl stamp scrip, time-banking systems (Edgar Cahn's TimeBanks), the
Bristol Pound, the Chiemgauer.

**Game-theoretic rationale:** Demurrage eliminates the strategy of "wait and accumulate."
In a system where money decays, the dominant strategy shifts from hoarding to circulation.
The velocity of money increases, which means more transactions per unit of currency, which
means the same economic activity can be supported with less total currency in circulation.
This is not a tax; it is a property of the medium, analogous to the way perishable goods
naturally compel trade.

#### 1.2 Embercoin (Regional Exchange)

**Scale:** Municipality to bioregion (approximately 50,000-5,000,000 people)

**Properties:**
- Issued by regional federations of local assemblies
- **Demurrage rate: 0.5% per month** (6% annual depreciation)
- Backed by a basket of real assets: renewable energy capacity, agricultural output,
  water access, housing stock
- Used for inter-community trade, infrastructure projects, regional investment
- Convertible from Hearthmoney at rates set by bilateral agreement between assemblies

**Mechanism:** Embercoin is created through a process modeled on quadratic funding. When
multiple communities identify a shared need (a bridge, a hospital, a fiber network),
they each contribute Hearthmoney. The regional federation matches these contributions
using a quadratic formula: the matching amount is proportional to the **square of the
number of contributing communities** rather than to the total amount contributed. This
means that projects supported by many small communities receive more matching than
projects supported by a few wealthy ones. It is a structural mechanism for making the
breadth of support matter more than the depth.

**Precedent:** WIR Bank (Switzerland), Sardex (Sardinia), the Brixton Pound, Gitcoin
quadratic funding rounds.

**Game-theoretic rationale:** Quadratic matching creates a strong incentive for broad
coalition-building. A community that wants a regional project funded has more to gain
from convincing ten other communities to contribute small amounts than from concentrating
resources within its own boundaries. This incentivizes cooperation and coalition-building
as the dominant strategy for resource acquisition.

#### 1.3 Ashtoken (Planetary Exchange)

**Scale:** Bioregion to planet

**Properties:**
- Issued by planetary federation protocols (not by any government or institution)
- **Demurrage rate: 0.25% per month** (3% annual depreciation)
- Denominated in planetary commons units: one Ashtoken represents a claim on a fraction
  of the global commons (atmosphere, oceans, biodiversity, electromagnetic spectrum,
  accumulated human knowledge)
- Used for inter-regional trade, planetary commons governance, global public goods
- Cannot be accumulated beyond a structurally enforced cap (see Burn Cycle)

**Mechanism:** Ashtokens are created through a protocol that operates like a
proof-of-contribution system (not proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, which reward
respectively energy expenditure and existing wealth). Contributions to planetary commons
-- carbon sequestration, biodiversity restoration, open-source knowledge production,
conflict resolution -- are verified through a distributed attestation network and
rewarded with Ashtokens. This means that the planetary currency is backed not by gold,
not by government fiat, but by **demonstrated contribution to the shared resource base
of humanity.**

**Precedent:** Proof-of-contribution systems in various crypto projects, carbon credit
markets (design, not implementation -- existing carbon markets are captured), the concept
of "natural capital" from ecological economics.

**Game-theoretic rationale:** By tying currency creation to commons contribution, the
Ashtoken makes planetary stewardship the most reliable path to medium-of-exchange
access. The strategy of extracting from the commons becomes self-defeating: it destroys
the very base that generates new currency. Contributing to the commons becomes the
dominant strategy because it is literally how the money is made.

#### 1.4 The Exchange Protocol

Currencies at different scales are convertible, but conversion is **friction-laden by
design.** Converting Hearthmoney to Embercoin is possible but involves a spread (a small
loss in the conversion). Converting Embercoin to Ashtokens involves a larger spread.
Converting downward (Ashtoken to Embercoin, Embercoin to Hearthmoney) is easier than
converting upward.

This friction is intentional. It creates a structural preference for economic activity at
the most local scale possible. Resources naturally "drain" toward the local level and must
be actively pushed upward. This reverses the dynamic of contemporary capitalism, where
value is systematically extracted from local economies and concentrated in global financial
centers.

The conversion protocol is managed by transparent, auditable algorithms -- no central
exchange, no intermediary that can extract rents. The protocol is open-source, forkable,
and modifiable by the communities that use it. The exchange rates themselves are determined
by bilateral agreements between assemblies at each scale, not by market speculation.

**Network analogy:** This is TCP/IP for money. Just as internet packets are routed
through multiple independent networks using a shared protocol, economic value moves
through multiple independent currency zones using a shared exchange protocol. No single
node controls the routing. No single failure can crash the system. Redundancy is a
feature, not a cost.

---

### System 2: The Commons Protocol

The Commons Protocol governs all shared resources -- natural, informational, and
infrastructural -- through a set of rules derived from Ostrom's eight principles but
extended to address the specific challenges of digital resources, planetary-scale commons,
and the prevention of commons capture by concentrated interests.

#### 2.1 Resource Classification

All resources in the Ember Economy are classified into one of four categories:

**Atmospheric Resources (non-excludable, rival in aggregate):** Air, climate stability,
the electromagnetic spectrum, ocean health. These are governed at the planetary scale
through the Ashtoken system. Use rights are universal; extraction beyond sustainable
yield is a commons offense.

**Terrestrial Resources (partially excludable, rival):** Land, water, minerals, forests,
fisheries. These are governed at the bioregional scale through assemblies of affected
communities. Use rights are allocated through Ostrom-style rules: clear boundaries,
proportional costs, collective decision-making, effective monitoring, graduated
sanctions.

**Constructed Resources (excludable, depreciable):** Infrastructure, buildings, machines,
tools. These are governed at the scale of the community that built and maintains them.
They are held in **common stewardship** -- not private ownership and not state ownership.
The community of users decides how they are maintained, improved, and allocated.
Constructed resources are subject to **Harberger-style self-assessment:** the steward of
a resource declares its value and pays a percentage of that value to the commons fund.
Any other community member can purchase stewardship at the declared price. This
mechanism ensures that resources are valued honestly (declare too low and someone buys it
from you; declare too high and your commons contribution becomes expensive) and that
stewardship is continuously contestable rather than permanently held.

**Informational Resources (non-excludable, non-rival):** Knowledge, data, algorithms,
cultural works, scientific discoveries. These are **structurally commons by default.**
The Ember Economy does not recognize intellectual property as a legitimate form of
enclosure. Information wants to be free not because of some mystical property but because
information is non-rival -- my use of an idea does not diminish your ability to use it --
and because enclosing information creates the information asymmetries that Pyrrhic
Lucidity identifies as the substrate of illegitimate power.

This does not mean creators are not compensated. It means they are compensated for the
act of creation (through Hearthmoney, Embercoin, or Ashtoken contributions) rather than
through the act of restricting access (copyright, patents, trade secrets). The economic
model for information is patronage and commons contribution, not enclosure and rent.

**Precedent:** Open-source software (Linux, Firefox, Wikipedia), Creative Commons
licensing, the Bayh-Dole Act in reverse, Indigenous knowledge systems.

#### 2.2 The Anti-Enclosure Mechanism

The most persistent threat to any commons is enclosure -- the conversion of shared
resources into private property. Historical enclosure movements (English commons
enclosure, colonial land seizure, the modern enclosure of digital commons through
intellectual property law) demonstrate that this threat is not theoretical.

The Ember Economy addresses enclosure through three structural mechanisms:

**Mechanism 1: Mandatory Sunset.** All stewardship rights over Terrestrial and Constructed
resources expire automatically after a fixed period (proposals: 7 years for individuals,
14 years for cooperatives, 21 years for community institutions -- the Jubilee structure
echoing Biblical and Mesopotamian precedent). At expiration, stewardship reverts to the
relevant commons assembly and must be re-allocated through a transparent process. This
prevents the dynastic accumulation that has historically converted temporary use-rights
into permanent ownership claims.

**Mechanism 2: Usage Decay.** Stewardship rights that are not actively exercised decay
faster than those that are. If you hold stewardship of agricultural land and leave it
fallow for two seasons without commons-approved ecological justification, your stewardship
decays at double the normal rate. This prevents the speculative holding of resources by
those who do not use them -- the urban landlord who sits on vacant apartments, the
corporation that holds patents it never commercializes.

**Mechanism 3: Concentration Caps.** No individual, cooperative, or institution may hold
stewardship over resources whose combined declared value exceeds a structurally defined
cap. The cap is set relative to the median, not in absolute terms: no stewardship
portfolio may exceed 10x the median portfolio value in a given commons domain. This is
not a wealth tax; it is a structural limit on accumulation, enforced by the protocol
itself. You cannot opt out of it because you cannot hold what the system will not let
you declare.

#### 2.3 The Information Commons

Information is the most critical commons in the Ember Economy because information
asymmetry is the substrate of economic power. The Information Commons is governed by
three absolute principles:

**Principle 1: Default Transparency.** All economic transactions above a de minimis
threshold are publicly visible. Not the identities of the parties (privacy is protected)
but the structure of the transaction: what was exchanged, at what rate, under what terms.
This eliminates the primary mechanism of information rent -- the ability to charge
different prices to different parties based on their differential ignorance.

**Principle 2: Algorithmic Legibility.** Any algorithm that mediates economic decisions
(pricing, allocation, matching, recommendation) must be open-source, auditable, and
comprehensible to a competent non-specialist. Opaque algorithms are a form of information
enclosure and are treated as such. This does not mean every person must read every
algorithm; it means every person must be able to find someone they trust who can read it
and explain it. This is the "newspaper test" applied to code.

**Principle 3: Symmetric Information by Default.** In any transaction, both parties have
access to the same information about the good, service, or resource being exchanged.
Where one party has materially more information than the other (the seller knows the
product's defects, the employer knows the industry wage range, the lender knows the
borrower's risk profile better than the borrower does), disclosure is mandatory.
Non-disclosure is treated as a form of theft -- the theft of the other party's capacity
for informed consent.

---

### System 3: The Production Mesh

The Ember Economy organizes production not through firms (hierarchical command structures)
or markets (atomized exchange between individuals) but through a **production mesh** -- a
federated network of cooperatively governed production units connected by protocols
rather than by ownership.

#### 3.1 The Cooperative as Base Unit

The base unit of production in the Ember Economy is the **worker cooperative** -- an
enterprise owned and governed by the people who work in it. This is not a utopian
proposal; it is the documented organizational form of Mondragon, Emilia-Romagna, and
thousands of successful cooperatives worldwide.

The Ember Economy adds structural features to the cooperative model to address its known
weaknesses:

**Balanced task portfolios:** Drawing on ParEcon's concept of balanced job complexes,
every cooperative member performs some combination of empowering tasks (planning,
coordination, creative work) and routine tasks (maintenance, data entry, physical labor).
This prevents the emergence of a managerial class within the cooperative -- the most
common failure mode of ostensibly democratic organizations, where those who control
information and make decisions gradually separate from those who execute them.

This does not mean everyone does every task. It means that the distribution of empowering
and routine work is balanced across all members, so that no one spends all their time
giving orders and no one spends all their time following them. The specific balance is
determined by each cooperative's assembly, not by external mandate.

**Mandatory rotation of coordination roles.** No individual may hold a coordination
(management) role in the same cooperative for more than three consecutive terms (a term
being 1-2 years, set by each cooperative). This is the economic analog of political term
limits. It prevents the professionalization of management -- the process by which
"temporary coordinator" becomes "permanent boss."

**Maximum compensation ratios.** The ratio between the highest-compensated and
lowest-compensated member of a cooperative cannot exceed a factor determined by the
cooperative's own assembly, with a structural ceiling of 8:1 across the economy. (For
reference, Mondragon originally used 3:1 and currently uses approximately 6:1. The
average ratio in US corporations is approximately 670:1.) This ceiling is not a moral
judgment; it is a game-theoretic mechanism. Research consistently shows that cooperation
breaks down when participants perceive the distribution of rewards as grossly unfair.
The threshold varies, but ratios above 8:1 reliably trigger defection behavior in
experimental settings.

**Open books.** All cooperative financial information is accessible to all members and
to the relevant commons assembly. There are no trade secrets, no proprietary financial
data, no information asymmetries between management and workers. This is Principle 3
(Transparent Mechanism) applied to the enterprise.

#### 3.2 The Production Network

Individual cooperatives are connected into **production networks** -- federated
structures that provide the benefits of scale without the pathologies of hierarchy.

Production networks operate through protocols, not through ownership or command. A
production network is not a corporation that owns its member cooperatives; it is a
protocol that enables member cooperatives to coordinate. The analogy is not General
Motors (a hierarchy that owns its subsidiaries) but the internet (a protocol that enables
independent networks to communicate).

**How production networks function:**

**Resource pooling:** Member cooperatives contribute to shared infrastructure (equipment,
training facilities, logistics, research) through the network. Contributions are
proportional to use. Access is governed by commons protocols.

**Knowledge sharing:** Production networks maintain open repositories of production
knowledge -- techniques, designs, process improvements, failure analyses. This is the
economic equivalent of open-source software development: the knowledge is a commons that
all members contribute to and draw from.

**Flexible production:** When an order exceeds a single cooperative's capacity, the
network coordinates distributed production across multiple cooperatives, each
contributing its specialized capability. This is the Emilia-Romagna model: a network of
small, specialized producers that can collectively match the output of a large factory
while maintaining human-scale governance and working conditions.

**Mutual insurance:** Network members contribute to a mutual fund that supports
cooperatives experiencing temporary difficulty (supply chain disruption, equipment
failure, demand shock). This eliminates the need for external financial markets and
the predatory dynamics they introduce. The Mondragon system's inter-cooperative
solidarity mechanisms are the direct precedent.

**Market interface:** For trade with entities outside the Ember Economy (during the
transition period, or permanently for inter-system trade), production networks
maintain collective bargaining capacity. Individual cooperatives do not negotiate
with external corporations; the network negotiates collectively, preventing the
divide-and-conquer strategies that corporations use against atomized suppliers.

#### 3.3 Automation and the Production Mesh

The Ember Economy does not resist automation. It restructures the relationship between
automation and labor.

In the current system, automation benefits the owners of capital (who replace labor costs
with machine costs and keep the difference) while harming workers (who lose income). This
is not a property of automation itself; it is a property of the ownership structure. In
a cooperative, where the workers are the owners, automation benefits everyone: it reduces
drudgery, increases output, and allows the freed labor-time to be directed toward care
work, creative work, ecological restoration, education, or leisure.

The Ember Economy treats automated systems as **constructed commons** -- owned by the
cooperative or the network, governed by the same commons protocols as all other shared
resources. The productivity gains from automation accrue to the cooperative's members
collectively, not to a separate class of shareholders.

This resolves the "technological unemployment" problem structurally. In a system where
workers own the machines, the more efficient the machines become, the less everyone has
to work. The question "but what will people do?" has a simple answer: whatever they
choose, freed from the compulsion of selling their labor to survive.

**AI specifically:** Artificial intelligence systems used in the Ember Economy are
informational commons. Their training data is commons (not proprietary), their
architectures are open-source, their decision-making is subject to algorithmic legibility
requirements. AI systems are tools of the production mesh, not autonomous agents with
economic interests. They are governed, not governing.

### System 4: The Burn Cycle

The Burn Cycle is the Ember Economy's central innovation. It is the mechanism by which
accumulated power -- in any form: currency, stewardship rights, decision-making authority,
informational advantage -- is structurally prevented from becoming permanent.

The name is deliberate. Fire, in ecology, is not destruction. It is the mechanism by
which accumulated biomass -- dead wood, dried leaves, the detritus of past growth -- is
converted into nutrients that feed new growth. Without fire, forests become choked with
dead wood, vulnerable to catastrophic conflagration, and inhospitable to new life. The
controlled burn is what maintains the forest's capacity for regeneration.

The Burn Cycle operates on three timescales:

#### 4.1 The Daily Ember (Continuous Demurrage)

Currency demurrage operates continuously. Every unit of every currency in the ecology
loses value at its specified rate. This is the background hum of the system -- a constant,
gentle pressure against accumulation that operates at all times, affecting everyone
equally.

The demurrage does not disappear. The value that decays from individual holdings is
captured by the commons fund at the relevant scale (local demurrage to local commons fund,
regional demurrage to regional commons fund, planetary demurrage to planetary commons
fund). From there it is redistributed as the universal floor (see below) and as commons
investment.

This is not a tax. Taxes are imposed by an authority on a population. Demurrage is a
property of the medium. No one imposes it; it is inherent. It would be like taxing
gravity. The authority to change the demurrage rate rests with the assembly at the
relevant scale, but the existence of demurrage is structural, not discretionary.

#### 4.2 The Seasonal Cycle (Quarterly Redistribution)

Every quarter (the duration is subject to adjustment by assemblies, but quarterly is the
default), the Seasonal Cycle operates:

**Step 1: The Accounting.** Every commons assembly (at every scale) publishes a
transparent account of: total currency in circulation, total stewardship holdings, the
distribution curve (how concentrated are holdings), and the status of the floor (how many
participants are below the minimum threshold for each of the doughnut's social
foundations).

**Step 2: The Floor Check.** If any participant within the assembly's jurisdiction falls
below the social foundation floor on any dimension, the assembly's commons fund is
mobilized to bring them to the floor. This is not charity; it is a structural guarantee.
The floor is the first claim on the commons fund, before any other use. No one falls
below the doughnut.

**Step 3: The Ceiling Check.** If any participant's accumulated holdings (across all
currency types and stewardship rights) exceed the concentration cap, the excess is
automatically transferred to the commons fund. This is not confiscation; it is the
operation of a structural limit that the participant knew about when they entered the
system. You cannot accumulate beyond the cap for the same reason you cannot accumulate
more than 100% of a finite resource -- the system does not permit it.

**Step 4: The Reallocation.** The commons fund, after meeting floor and ceiling
obligations, is allocated through participatory budgeting. Every assembly member has
an equal voice in determining how surplus commons funds are invested. This is direct
economic democracy -- not "voting for representatives who make economic decisions" but
actual participation in economic decision-making.

**Precedent:** Participatory budgeting (Porto Alegre, Brazil), the Athenian sortition
system, the Biblical Jubilee, Mesopotamian debt amnesties, the potlatch.

#### 4.3 The Great Burn (Generational Reset)

Every generation (default: 25 years, adjustable by multi-scale assembly), the Great Burn
operates:

**All stewardship rights expire simultaneously.** Every stewardship claim over every
Terrestrial and Constructed resource in the economy reverts to the relevant commons
assembly. Every individual, cooperative, and institution starts the next generation with
their personal possessions and their labor capacity, but without accumulated stewardship
of shared resources.

This is the Jubilee. It is the most radical element of the Ember Economy and the most
important. Without it, the other mechanisms are friction against the tide of accumulation
-- they slow it, they cannot stop it. The Great Burn stops it. It is the structural
firebreak that prevents the forests of accumulated power from becoming the catastrophic
conflagrations that history records as revolutions, civil wars, and civilizational
collapses.

**"But no one would invest if they knew it would be taken away!"** This objection assumes
that investment is motivated primarily by the desire to accumulate permanent private
wealth. The evidence from cooperative economies suggests otherwise. People invest in
enterprises they control, in communities they belong to, in infrastructure they use. The
Great Burn does not eliminate the incentive to invest; it redirects it from "building a
dynasty" to "building something good enough that the next generation's assembly will want
to renew my stewardship, or something so well-built that whoever takes it over will
benefit from my work."

**"But this would cause chaos every 25 years!"** The Great Burn is not a surprise. It is
a known, scheduled, structural event. Economic actors plan for it, just as they plan for
any known future event. Moreover, the quarterly Seasonal Cycles provide continuous,
smaller-scale redistribution that prevents the Great Burn from being a sudden shock.
The Great Burn is the final clearing of whatever residual accumulation the continuous
and quarterly mechanisms have not addressed.

**"But who enforces it?"** The protocol enforces it. Stewardship rights in the Ember
Economy are recorded on a distributed ledger with built-in expiration. When the
expiration date arrives, the right ceases to function -- not because an enforcer comes
and takes it away, but because the system stops recognizing it. This is how digital
certificates work: they expire, and the system simply stops trusting them. The Great
Burn is an expiration, not a confiscation.

**Historical precedent:** The Mesopotamian amargi (debt cancellations proclaimed by
Sumerian and Babylonian kings at key moments), the Athenian seisachtheia (Solon's
comprehensive debt cancellation of 594 BCE, which freed debt slaves, restored confiscated
land, and laid the groundwork for Athenian democracy), the Biblical Jubilee (Leviticus 25:
every 50 years, land returns to original families, slaves are freed, debts are cancelled),
the Roman agrarian laws (repeated attempts to redistribute land that had been concentrated
through debt and conquest). The pattern is clear: societies that do not perform periodic
resets experience accumulation that eventually becomes unsustainable and is resolved
through violent upheaval. The Great Burn is an alternative to revolution -- a structural
mechanism that accomplishes through protocol what history has accomplished through blood.

### System 5: The Transparency Lattice

If information asymmetry is the substrate of economic power, then transparency is the
substrate of economic justice. The Transparency Lattice is the information architecture
that makes the Ember Economy legible -- not to a central authority, but to every
participant.

#### 5.1 The Public Ledger

All economic activity in the Ember Economy is recorded on a distributed public ledger.
This is not a blockchain in the current sense (energy-intensive proof-of-work or
plutocratic proof-of-stake). It is a **distributed ledger maintained by the commons
assemblies** at each scale, using a consensus mechanism weighted by contribution to
commons governance rather than by capital holdings.

The ledger records:

- **Currency transactions** (amounts, timestamps, currency type -- not personal
  identities, which are pseudonymous)
- **Stewardship transfers** (who holds stewardship of what, at what self-assessed value,
  with what expiration date)
- **Commons fund flows** (how much enters the commons fund from demurrage, ceiling
  enforcement, and contributions, and how it is allocated)
- **Assembly decisions** (all governance decisions, with the reasoning, the vote counts,
  and the dissenting positions recorded)

This ledger is the "glass box" that makes the Ember Economy self-auditing. Any
participant can verify that the system is operating as designed. Any analyst can identify
patterns -- emerging concentration, declining floor coverage, commons depletion -- and
bring them to the relevant assembly for action.

#### 5.2 The Information Ombudsman

Every commons assembly elects (by sortition, not by vote -- to prevent information
capture by the politically skilled) an **Information Ombudsman** whose sole function is to
investigate and publicize information asymmetries. The Ombudsman has no enforcement power;
they have only the power of publication. They can compel disclosure (within the rules set
by the assembly) and publish findings.

The Ombudsman is the institutional embodiment of Pyrrhic Lucidity's first principle:
Lucidity Before Liberation. Their function is not to fix problems but to make problems
visible. The assumption is that a well-informed community of participants, armed with
accurate information about how their economy actually operates, will make better decisions
than any expert planner could make on their behalf.

**Game-theoretic rationale:** The Ombudsman changes the payoff matrix for information
concealment. In a system without an Ombudsman, concealing information is a low-risk,
high-reward strategy (you gain information rents, and the probability of detection is
low). In a system with an Ombudsman, concealment becomes high-risk (the probability of
detection and publication increases dramatically) and the reward decreases (the community
is already so well-informed that the available information rents are small).

#### 5.3 Algorithmic Transparency

Every algorithm that operates within the Ember Economy -- every piece of code that makes
decisions about resource allocation, pricing, matching, or distribution -- is subject to
the **three laws of algorithmic transparency:**

1. **Legibility:** The algorithm must be expressible in terms that a competent
   non-specialist can understand. This does not mean the code must be simple; it means
   the *logic* must be explicable. "This algorithm assigns production quotas based on
   weighted historical demand, adjusted for seasonal variation and resource availability"
   is legible. "This neural network produces outputs that we cannot explain but that seem
   to work" is not.

2. **Auditability:** The algorithm's inputs, outputs, and decision process must be
   loggable and reviewable. Any participant affected by an algorithmic decision can
   request an audit trail showing how the decision was reached.

3. **Forkability:** Any community that disagrees with an algorithm's design can fork it
   -- create a modified version and propose it to their assembly as an alternative. This
   is the economic application of free software principles: the code that governs your
   economic life must be modifiable by your community.

---

### System 6: The Scale Stack

The Ember Economy operates at multiple scales simultaneously, with governance appropriate
to each scale. This is Murray Bookchin's libertarian municipalism combined with Ostrom's
polycentrism, implemented through network protocols rather than political hierarchy.

#### 6.1 The Household (1-15 people)

The household operates by baseline communism. Resources are shared according to need.
Contributions are made according to ability. No accounting is kept. This is not a
designed feature; it is the natural mode of human interaction at this scale. The Ember
Economy simply does not interfere with it.

#### 6.2 The Neighborhood (50-500 people)

The neighborhood is the primary site of Hearthmoney circulation and the smallest scale
of commons governance. The neighborhood assembly meets regularly (monthly or more
frequently, as the neighborhood decides) to:

- Set and adjust local Hearthmoney demurrage rates (within structural bounds)
- Allocate commons fund resources
- Resolve disputes through informal mediation
- Elect (by sortition) the neighborhood's delegates to the municipal assembly
- Manage neighborhood-scale constructed commons (shared tools, spaces, equipment)

**Decision-making:** Modified consensus with a fallback to supermajority vote. Decisions
require a genuine attempt at consensus (not mere absence of objection, but active
exploration of dissent). If consensus cannot be reached, a 2/3 supermajority vote
suffices, but dissenting positions are recorded and reviewed at the next assembly.

#### 6.3 The Municipality (500-50,000 people)

The municipality is a federation of neighborhoods. The municipal assembly consists of
delegates selected by sortition from each neighborhood, serving staggered terms (so that
the entire assembly never turns over simultaneously). The municipality governs:

- Municipal-scale commons (water systems, roads, public spaces, energy infrastructure)
- Embercoin issuance and demurrage rates for the municipality's contribution to the
  regional system
- Inter-neighborhood dispute resolution
- Production network coordination at the municipal level
- The municipal floor guarantee (ensuring every resident meets all doughnut social
  foundation criteria)

**Adversarial collaboration:** The municipal assembly includes a mandatory
**counter-assembly** -- a body selected by sortition from among those who voted against
or dissented from the majority position on each major decision. The counter-assembly's
function is to stress-test decisions, identify risks the majority missed, and publish
dissenting analyses. This is Principle 4 (Adversarial Collaboration) built into economic
governance.

#### 6.4 The Bioregion (50,000-5,000,000 people)

The bioregion is the natural unit of ecological governance -- defined not by political
boundaries but by watersheds, ecosystems, and ecological interdependence. The bioregional
assembly governs:

- Bioregional commons (rivers, forests, fisheries, mineral deposits)
- Embercoin regional policy
- Inter-municipal infrastructure
- Bioregional production network coordination
- Bioregional ecological accounting (monitoring whether the bioregion is within or
  beyond its ecological ceiling)

**Scale principle:** The bioregion is the largest scale at which face-to-face governance
is possible (through delegation chains) and the smallest scale at which ecological
governance is meaningful. It is the pivot point of the scale stack -- the level at which
local needs and planetary constraints must be reconciled.

#### 6.5 The Planetary Federation

The planetary scale is governed not by a world government but by a **protocol** -- a set
of rules for inter-bioregional coordination that no single bioregion controls. The
planetary federation governs:

- Ashtoken issuance and commons accounting
- Atmospheric and oceanic commons
- Planetary-scale public goods (scientific research, disease prevention, asteroid defense,
  space stewardship)
- Inter-bioregional conflict resolution
- The planetary ecological ceiling (ensuring that the sum of all bioregional economic
  activity does not exceed planetary boundaries)

**Decision-making:** Planetary decisions are made by a multi-round deliberative process:

1. **Proposal:** Any bioregion can propose a planetary-level decision.
2. **Deliberation:** All bioregions engage in structured deliberation, with mandatory
   adversarial review.
3. **Indicative vote:** Each bioregion votes (internally, by its own process).
   Population-weighted and bioregion-weighted votes are reported separately.
4. **Revision:** If the two weightings diverge, the proposal is revised and re-deliberated.
5. **Ratification:** Decisions require supermajority under both weightings.

This dual-weighting system prevents both tyranny of the majority (large-population
bioregions dominating) and tyranny of the minority (small-population bioregions blocking).
It is the analog of bicameralism, but without the class bias that historically
characterized upper houses.

## PART III: GAME-THEORETIC ANALYSIS

### Why Cooperation is the Dominant Strategy

The Ember Economy is not designed for saints. It is designed for the composite self --
a self that is neither purely selfish nor purely altruistic, that responds to incentives,
that is capable of both cooperation and defection, and that reliably gravitates toward
whatever strategy produces the best outcomes given the structural conditions.

The key insight from Axelrod's tournaments and subsequent game theory research is that
**cooperation is the dominant strategy in iterated games with observable actions,
graduated sanctions, and the shadow of the future.** Defection dominates only in
one-shot games, games with hidden actions, or games where the future is sufficiently
uncertain.

The Ember Economy is designed to make every economic interaction an iterated game with
observable actions and a long shadow of the future:

#### Mechanism 1: Iteration Through Community Embeddedness

In the Ember Economy, economic actors are not anonymous market participants who interact
once and disappear. They are members of neighborhoods, municipalities, and bioregions
who will interact repeatedly over extended periods. This transforms every economic
interaction from a one-shot game (where defection is tempting) into an iterated game
(where defection is costly because it invites retaliation in future rounds).

This is not a novel insight -- it is the mechanism by which all small-scale human
economies have functioned for millennia. The Ember Economy simply preserves this
mechanism at larger scales through its nested governance structure.

#### Mechanism 2: Observability Through Transparency

The Transparency Lattice ensures that economic actions are observable. In a system where
all transactions are recorded, all stewardship holdings are public, and information
asymmetries are actively investigated, defection (cheating, free-riding,
rent-extraction) is observable. Observable defection can be sanctioned. Sanctionable
defection is not a dominant strategy.

This addresses the core game-theoretic problem with contemporary markets: they are
anonymous by design, which makes defection unobservable, which makes defection
profitable, which makes defection the dominant strategy, which makes cooperation
irrational. The Ember Economy inverts this by making transparency the default and
opacity the exception.

#### Mechanism 3: Graduated Sanctions Through Commons Governance

Ostrom's fifth principle -- graduated sanctions -- is built into every level of the Ember
Economy. First offenses against commons rules are met with warning and community
conversation. Repeated offenses escalate through fines (in the relevant currency),
temporary suspension of commons access, and ultimately exclusion from the commons
assembly. The graduation is important: harsh punishment for first offenses deters
cooperation (people avoid participating in systems where a single mistake is catastrophic),
while no punishment for any offense invites free-riding.

#### Mechanism 4: Structural Incentive Alignment

The Burn Cycle aligns individual incentives with collective welfare:

- **Demurrage** makes hoarding costly, so the individually rational strategy shifts from
  "accumulate" to "circulate." What is good for the system (high velocity of money,
  broad distribution) is also good for the individual (avoiding depreciation losses).

- **Concentration caps** make excessive accumulation literally impossible within the
  system. When the maximum is structurally defined, competition shifts from "who can
  accumulate the most" to "who can contribute the most within the cap" -- a competition
  that benefits the commons rather than draining it.

- **Quadratic matching** makes broad support more valuable than concentrated support.
  An actor seeking resources for a project benefits more from building a broad coalition
  of supporters than from cultivating a single wealthy patron. This makes
  coalition-building (a cooperative strategy) more rewarding than patronage-seeking
  (a hierarchical strategy).

- **Proof-of-contribution** at the Ashtoken level means that the most reliable way to
  access planetary-scale resources is to contribute to planetary commons. Extraction is
  self-defeating; contribution is self-enriching. The alignment is structural, not moral.

#### Mechanism 5: The Shadow of the Future (The Burn Cycle)

The Great Burn -- the generational reset of all stewardship rights -- creates a
specific incentive structure: any accumulation strategy that relies on permanence is
guaranteed to fail. The only strategies that produce lasting value are those that
create genuine benefit for the community (and thus motivate the next generation's
assembly to renew stewardship) or those that produce value in the form of personal
skill, knowledge, and relationships (which the Great Burn does not touch).

This shifts the incentive landscape from **positional goods** (I win only if you lose --
the zero-sum game of accumulation) to **relational goods** (we all benefit from better
relationships, more knowledge, more trust -- the positive-sum game of community
building).

### The Defection Problem: What About Bad Actors?

Any economic system must answer the question: what happens when someone defects?

**Small-scale defection (cheating, free-riding, minor commons violations):** Handled
through graduated sanctions within the commons assembly. The key insight from game theory
is that the *threat* of punishment is more important than its actual application.
In a system where defection is observable and sanctions are certain but graduated, most
actors will not defect because the expected cost exceeds the expected benefit.

**Large-scale defection (attempting to exit the system with accumulated resources,
organizing a counter-system based on accumulation):** This is the hard case. The Ember
Economy's response has three layers:

1. **The medium itself resists extraction.** Hearthmoney, Embercoin, and Ashtokens are
   not convertible to external currencies at favorable rates. Attempting to "cash out"
   of the Ember Economy means accepting a massive conversion loss. The more you try to
   extract, the more you lose. This is by design.

2. **Network effects favor the system.** As the Ember Economy grows, the benefits of
   participation increase (more goods and services available, more cooperative partners,
   better commons infrastructure). The benefits of defection decrease (fewer trading
   partners outside the system, no commons access, no floor guarantee). The tipping point
   is the point at which the cost of leaving exceeds the benefit of staying for the
   median participant.

3. **The system is forkable.** If a sufficiently large group disagrees with the system's
   rules, they can fork it -- take the open-source protocols, modify them, and establish
   a separate system. This is not a bug; it is a pressure valve. The ability to exit
   constrains the system from becoming oppressive, while the cost of exit constrains
   participants from defecting frivolously.

---

## PART IV: TECHNOLOGY ENABLERS

### The Stack

The Ember Economy requires technology, but it does not require any technology that does
not already exist or that cannot be built with current capabilities. The technology stack
is:

#### Layer 1: Mesh Networking (Physical)

The Ember Economy's communication infrastructure cannot depend on corporate-owned
networks. Mesh networks -- peer-to-peer radio networks where each device is both a
receiver and a transmitter -- provide the physical layer. Technologies like LoRa,
Meshtastic, and community Wi-Fi meshes provide communication infrastructure that is
owned by its users, cannot be centrally shut down, and operates at low cost.

At village scale, a mesh network can be built for hundreds of dollars. At municipal
scale, tens of thousands. At bioregional scale, the mesh interconnects through a
combination of peer-to-peer radio, community fiber, and satellite links. The point is
not that every participant must operate a mesh node, but that the mesh must exist as a
fallback -- a communication infrastructure that survives the failure or capture of
commercial networks.

#### Layer 2: Distributed Ledger (Data)

The currency ecology, stewardship registry, commons accounting, and assembly records
are maintained on a distributed ledger. This is not a conventional blockchain. The
design principles are:

- **Low energy:** No proof-of-work. Consensus is achieved through a mechanism weighted
  by commons participation, not by computation or capital.
- **Privacy-preserving:** Transactions are publicly auditable in aggregate but
  pseudonymous in detail. Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without disclosure
  of personal identity.
- **Locally maintainable:** The ledger can be maintained by community-operated hardware.
  No specialized mining equipment, no cloud infrastructure dependency.
- **Forkable:** The ledger software is open-source and designed to be forked. Any
  community that disagrees with the ledger's rules can create a parallel ledger.

#### Layer 3: Decision Support (Intelligence)

AI systems -- specifically, locally-operated large language models -- serve as decision
support for commons assemblies. They do not make decisions; they analyze data, summarize
information, model scenarios, and present options. Their function is to make the
Transparency Lattice comprehensible to ordinary participants who cannot personally
analyze raw ledger data.

These AI systems are:
- **Locally operated:** Running on community-owned hardware, not on corporate cloud
  services. The community's data does not leave the community's infrastructure.
- **Open-source:** Their code, training data, and model weights are commons resources.
- **Auditable:** Their recommendations include explanations that a non-specialist can
  evaluate.
- **Adversarially tested:** Each assembly's AI system is periodically subjected to
  red-team analysis by the counter-assembly's AI system (or by human analysts) to
  identify biases, errors, and capture.

#### Layer 4: Production Coordination (Logistics)

The production mesh requires coordination tools: inventory management, supply chain
tracking, demand forecasting, quality assurance. These are standard industrial software
functions, but in the Ember Economy they are implemented as open-source, cooperatively
governed platforms.

Platform cooperativism provides the model: the digital platforms that coordinate economic
activity are owned by their users, not by shareholders. The "Uber of the Ember Economy"
is a cooperative owned by its drivers. The "Amazon of the Ember Economy" is a logistics
cooperative owned by its warehouses, delivery workers, and the communities they serve.

---

## PART V: THE TRANSITION

### How Do We Get From Here to There?

This is the hardest question. A beautiful economic model is worthless if there is no path
from the current system to the new one. The Ember Economy's transition strategy is based
on three principles:

#### Principle 1: Dual Power (Build the New Within the Shell of the Old)

The Ember Economy does not require revolution. It does not require capturing the state.
It does not require the collapse of capitalism. It requires building functional
alternatives that are so obviously better for their participants that they grow
organically.

**Phase 1: Local Currency Experiments.** Establish Hearthmoney systems in communities that
are already organized (existing cooperatives, intentional communities, mutual aid
networks). Demonstrate that demurrage currency works, that it increases economic activity,
that it builds community resilience. This can begin tomorrow with a handful of people
and a spreadsheet.

**Phase 2: Cooperative Production.** Convert existing businesses to cooperatives or
establish new cooperatives that accept Hearthmoney alongside conventional currency. Build
production networks that demonstrate the viability of federated cooperative production.
The Mondragon and Emilia-Romagna models provide playbooks. Start with services (repair,
food production, care work, education) where the advantages of cooperative organization
are most immediately visible.

**Phase 3: Commons Infrastructure.** Build the physical infrastructure of the Ember
Economy: mesh networks, community data centers, shared production facilities, renewable
energy cooperatives. Each piece of infrastructure reduces the community's dependence on
corporate systems and increases its capacity for self-governance.

**Phase 4: Regional Federation.** As local Ember economies mature, federate them into
bioregional networks. Establish Embercoin systems for inter-community trade. Build
bioregional commons governance for shared ecological resources. This phase requires the
participation of multiple communities and may take years or decades.

**Phase 5: Planetary Protocol.** When sufficient bioregional networks exist, establish the
Ashtoken protocol for planetary-scale coordination. This is the longest-term goal and may
take generations. But the point is that each earlier phase provides immediate, tangible
benefits to its participants. No one needs to wait for the planetary protocol to benefit
from Hearthmoney.

#### Principle 2: Compatibility During Transition

During the transition, the Ember Economy must interface with the conventional economy. This
means:

- Cooperatives within the Ember Economy may need to accept and hold conventional currency
  for trade with non-Ember entities.
- Participants may need to earn conventional wages and convert them to Ember currencies.
- Legal structures (cooperatives, mutual benefit associations, commons trusts) must
  operate within existing legal frameworks.

The key is that the interface is a **membrane, not an opening.** Conventional currency
can enter the Ember Economy (through conversion to Hearthmoney or Embercoin at rates set
by assemblies), but Ember currencies cannot easily leave. This prevents capital flight
and ensures that value that enters the system tends to stay in the system.

#### Principle 3: Prefigurative Practice

The transition is not a period of compromise to be endured until the "real" system
arrives. The transition IS the system at an early stage of development. Every practice
during the transition must embody the principles of the mature system. If cooperative
governance is the goal, then the transition organizations must be cooperatively governed.
If transparency is the goal, then the transition organizations must be transparent. If
the Burn Cycle is the goal, then the transition organizations must build in structural
term limits and periodic resets from day one.

This is the Pyrrhic Lucidity principle of Recursive Accountability applied to economic
transition: the means must be consistent with the ends, because in practice, the means
become the ends.

---

## PART VI: OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "This is too complex. No one will understand it."

The current economic system is incomprehensibly complex -- derivatives, collateralized
debt obligations, quantitative easing, shadow banking, high-frequency trading. The
difference is that the current system's complexity is hidden behind a facade of
simplicity ("just let the market decide") while the Ember Economy's complexity is
transparent. Transparent complexity is navigable; hidden complexity is exploitable.

Moreover, no individual participant needs to understand the entire system. A neighborhood
participant needs to understand Hearthmoney and the neighborhood assembly. A production
cooperative member needs to understand their cooperative's governance and their production
network's protocols. The scale stack ensures that complexity is distributed across levels,
with each level being comprehensible at its own scale.

### Objection 2: "Demurrage will kill investment."

Investment in the conventional sense -- deploying capital with the expectation of a
financial return -- is indeed discouraged by demurrage. But investment in the broader
sense -- deploying resources to create something of value -- is incentivized by demurrage,
because holding resources idle is costly. The choice is not "invest or save." The choice
is "invest or watch your resources decay." This makes investment in productive activity
the dominant strategy.

The WIR system, the Worgl experiment, and time-banking systems all demonstrate that
demurrage currencies generate more economic activity, not less.

### Objection 3: "The Great Burn will cause people to strip assets before the reset."

If stewardship rights expire and the underlying resource reverts to the commons, there
is no incentive to strip the resource. Stripping it does not transfer value to you (the
proceeds of stripping are in currency, which is also subject to demurrage and
concentration caps). And stripping it harms your community, which harms you because you
are embedded in that community. The incentive structure actually favors maintaining the
resource in good condition, because a well-maintained resource is more likely to result
in renewed stewardship from the next assembly.

### Objection 4: "Without profit motive, there will be no innovation."

The evidence does not support this claim. The greatest innovations in human history --
language, agriculture, mathematics, the scientific method, the internet, the World Wide
Web, Linux, Wikipedia -- were not motivated by profit. They were motivated by curiosity,
necessity, recognition, and the desire to solve problems. The Ember Economy provides all
of these motivations. What it does not provide is the ability to use a temporary
informational advantage (a patent, a trade secret) to extract rents for decades. This is
not innovation; it is enclosure.

### Objection 5: "This is just communism with extra steps."

It is not. Communism (in its Marxist-Leninist form) centralized ownership in the state,
eliminated markets, and concentrated decision-making in a vanguard party. The Ember
Economy decentralizes ownership to commons assemblies, preserves exchange (with structural
modifications), and distributes decision-making to the most local feasible level. The
differences are structural, not cosmetic.

The Ember Economy shares with communism a commitment to preventing the private
appropriation of the productive base of society. It departs from communism in its
mechanisms (commons governance rather than state ownership), its epistemology (epistemic
humility rather than historical materialism), its politics (polycentric federalism
rather than democratic centralism), and its relationship to human motivation (designing
for the composite self rather than assuming the perfectibility of humanity).

### Objection 6: "What about trade with the rest of the world?"

The Ember Economy can trade with conventional economies through its membrane interface.
Production networks can sell goods and services for conventional currency, convert the
proceeds to Ember currencies, and distribute them through cooperative governance. The
key is that the trade relationship does not compromise the internal structure of the
Ember Economy. You can sell to a capitalist economy without being a capitalist economy,
just as a cooperative can sell products to a corporation without becoming a corporation.

### Objection 7: "Who decides the demurrage rates, the concentration caps, the
compensation ratios?"

The assemblies at each scale decide, through transparent, participatory, adversarially
reviewed processes. The structural parameters of the system (that demurrage exists, that
concentration caps exist, that compensation ratios are bounded) are not subject to
override -- they are properties of the architecture, not policy choices. But the specific
values of these parameters (what percentage of demurrage, what level of cap, what ratio)
are set by assemblies and adjustable over time.

This is the distinction between constitutional provisions and legislation. The
constitution says "there shall be a concentration cap." The assembly says "the cap shall
be 10x the median." The constitution is hard to change (requiring supermajority across
multiple scales). The legislation is adjustable through normal assembly processes.

## PART VII: THE NAME AND ITS MEANING

The Ember Economy. Not the Fire Economy -- fire is the crisis, the burning away. The
ember is what remains: persistent, hot, capable of reignition, but not consuming
everything around it. An ember is energy in a sustainable state -- not the explosive
release of combustion but the slow, steady glow of maintained capacity.

The name echoes the Cleansing Fire project's central metaphor while shifting the emphasis
from destruction to persistence. The fire burns the dead wood. The ember is what you
build a new fire from. The economy we need is not a conflagration; it is a hearth --
a controlled, tended, shared source of warmth that serves the community and does not
consume it.

The currencies carry the metaphor: **Hearthmoney** (the warmth of the local hearth),
**Embercoin** (the persistent regional glow), **Ashtoken** (what fire leaves behind --
the mineral-rich residue that feeds new growth, the most processed form of the cycle,
the planetary-scale medium that represents the accumulated wisdom of burning away what
does not serve life).

---

## PART VIII: RELATIONSHIP TO PYRRHIC LUCIDITY

The Ember Economy is the economic expression of Pyrrhic Lucidity's seven principles:

**Principle 1 (Lucidity Before Liberation):** The Transparency Lattice ensures that
economic decisions are made in conditions of maximum information. The Information
Ombudsman ensures that the system's own distortions are continuously surfaced.

**Principle 2 (Relational Agency):** The production mesh, the commons assemblies, and
the scale stack all locate economic agency in relationships rather than in individuals.
The unit of economic action is not the rational maximizer but the cooperative network.

**Principle 3 (Transparent Mechanism):** Every mechanism in the Ember Economy -- currency
issuance, demurrage, the Burn Cycle, commons allocation, assembly decisions -- is visible,
comprehensible, and alterable by those subject to it. Illegitimate economic power is
defined structurally: economic power that operates through hidden mechanisms.

**Principle 4 (Adversarial Collaboration):** The counter-assembly, the Information
Ombudsman, and the forkability of every protocol ensure that structured dissent is built
into economic governance. No economic decision goes unchallenged.

**Principle 5 (Minimum Viable Coercion):** The Ember Economy uses the minimum structure
necessary to prevent accumulation and maintain the floor. It does not prescribe what
people produce, how they organize their work, or what they consume. It only structures
the medium of exchange (to prevent hoarding), the commons (to prevent enclosure), and
the distribution of power (to prevent concentration).

**Principle 6 (Recursive Accountability):** The assemblies that govern the economy are
themselves governed by assemblies, in a recursive chain that terminates in public
transparency. Economic leaders are subject to term limits, sortition, and the Great Burn.
There is no position of permanent economic authority.

**Principle 7 (Differential Solidarity):** The floor guarantee ensures that the most
economically exposed are the first priority of the commons fund. The concentration cap
ensures that accumulation is structurally limited. The quadratic matching ensures that
projects supported by many small communities receive more than projects supported by
few large ones. The system is structurally tilted toward those with less, not as charity
but as architecture.

## PART IX: ON INCOMPLETENESS

This model is incomplete. It must be.

The specification of demurrage rates, concentration caps, compensation ratios, assembly
procedures, ledger protocols, and transition timelines will require experimentation,
iteration, and revision. The numbers proposed here (1% monthly demurrage, 10x
concentration cap, 8:1 compensation ratio, 25-year Great Burn cycle) are starting
points, not dogma. They are derived from historical evidence and theoretical analysis,
but they will need to be tested against reality and adjusted.

What is not subject to adjustment is the architecture -- the structural commitments that
define the Ember Economy:

- **Multiple currencies with demurrage** (the specific rates are adjustable; the
  existence of demurrage is not)
- **Commons governance of shared resources** (the specific rules are adjustable; the
  governance by affected communities is not)
- **Cooperative production with structural limits on hierarchy** (the specific limits
  are adjustable; the cooperative structure is not)
- **The Burn Cycle** (the specific timing is adjustable; the existence of periodic
  structural reset is not)
- **The Transparency Lattice** (the specific mechanisms are adjustable; the commitment
  to structural transparency is not)
- **The Scale Stack** (the specific governance procedures are adjustable; the polycentric
  nested structure is not)

These structural commitments are the constitution of the Ember Economy. Everything else
is legislation -- adjustable, revisable, experimentable. The constitution is deliberately
minimal: it specifies the shape of the space within which experimentation occurs, not the
content of the experiments.

This is the application of Pyrrhic Lucidity to economics: **see clearly, design for
self-correction, accept cost, and act anyway.** The Ember Economy will be wrong about
many things. The commitment is to maintaining the structures through which wrongness can
be detected, acknowledged, and corrected -- without those corrections being captured by
the very accumulative dynamics the system was designed to prevent.

## APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS

**Ashtoken:** The planetary-scale currency of the Ember Economy. Created through
proof-of-contribution to planetary commons. Subject to 0.25% monthly demurrage.

**Burn Cycle:** The three-timescale redistribution mechanism: daily demurrage (continuous),
the Seasonal Cycle (quarterly), and the Great Burn (generational).

**Commons Protocol:** The governance framework for shared resources, derived from Ostrom's
eight principles and extended for digital, informational, and planetary-scale commons.

**Concentration Cap:** A structural limit on the maximum accumulation of stewardship
rights and currency holdings, set relative to the median (default: 10x).

**Counter-Assembly:** A body within each municipal and bioregional assembly composed of
dissenters, selected by sortition, whose function is to stress-test majority decisions.

**Currency Ecology:** The multi-currency system comprising Hearthmoney, Embercoin, and
Ashtoken, with intentional friction in cross-scale conversion.

**Demurrage:** The designed depreciation of currency over time, incentivizing circulation
over hoarding. Different rates at different scales.

**Ember Economy:** The comprehensive economic model proposed in this document: polycentric,
multi-currency, commons-based, with built-in structural decay of accumulated power.

**Embercoin:** The regional-scale currency. Created through quadratic matching of
community contributions. Subject to 0.5% monthly demurrage.

**Floor Guarantee:** The structural commitment that no participant falls below the social
foundation of the doughnut (food, water, health, education, housing, energy, political
voice, social equity).

**Great Burn:** The generational reset (default: every 25 years) in which all stewardship
rights expire and revert to commons assemblies for reallocation.

**Harberger Self-Assessment:** The mechanism for governing constructed commons: stewards
declare a value, pay a percentage to the commons fund, and accept that anyone can
purchase stewardship at the declared price.

**Hearthmoney:** The local-scale currency. Denominated in labor-hours. Subject to 1%
monthly demurrage. Issued by neighborhood and municipal assemblies.

**Information Commons:** The structural designation of all knowledge, data, algorithms,
and cultural works as commons resources not subject to private enclosure.

**Information Ombudsman:** An assembly officer selected by sortition whose function is to
investigate and publicize information asymmetries within the economic system.

**Membrane Interface:** The controlled boundary between the Ember Economy and conventional
economies, allowing trade while preventing structural capture.

**Production Mesh:** The federated network of cooperatively governed production units
connected by protocols rather than ownership.

**Proof-of-Contribution:** The mechanism for Ashtoken creation, rewarding demonstrated
contribution to planetary commons rather than computation or capital.

**Quadratic Matching:** The mechanism for Embercoin creation, where matching funds are
proportional to the square of the number of contributors rather than the sum of
contributions.

**Scale Stack:** The nested governance structure from household to planet, with governance
appropriate to each scale.

**Seasonal Cycle:** The quarterly redistribution process: accounting, floor check,
ceiling check, and participatory reallocation.

**Transparency Lattice:** The information architecture ensuring that all economic activity
is publicly auditable, all algorithms are legible, and all information asymmetries are
actively investigated.

## APPENDIX B: DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

The following questions can be applied to any economic system, including the Ember Economy
itself, to assess its alignment with Pyrrhic Lucidity:

1. Can an ordinary participant explain how prices are set, how resources are allocated,
   and how decisions are made in this economy? (Transparency)

2. Does this economy have structural mechanisms that prevent the concentration of
   wealth, or does it rely on the goodwill of the wealthy? (Anti-accumulation)

3. Does this economy have structural mechanisms for periodic redistribution, or does
   it assume that initial distributions persist indefinitely? (Cyclicality)

4. Can this economy function if a major component fails -- a currency collapse, a
   supply chain disruption, a natural disaster -- or does the failure cascade?
   (Resilience)

5. Does this economy treat information asymmetry as a normal feature of markets or as
   a form of structural extraction? (Information justice)

6. Are the people who produce goods and services also the people who govern the
   enterprises that produce them? (Democratic production)

7. Is there a floor below which no participant can fall, and is that floor enforced
   structurally rather than through discretionary policy? (Social foundation)

8. Is there a ceiling above which no participant can accumulate, and is that ceiling
   enforced structurally rather than through discretionary policy? (Concentration limit)

9. Can the rules of this economy be changed by those subject to them, through
   transparent and participatory processes? (Self-governance)

10. Does this economy require a particular kind of human nature (pure altruism, pure
    rationality, perfect information) or does it function with humans as they actually
    are? (Realism)

## APPENDIX C: KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

Intellectual honesty demands cataloging the known weaknesses of the model:

**1. The Bootstrapping Problem.** The Ember Economy requires a critical mass of
participants to function. Before that critical mass is reached, the system may be less
attractive than conventional participation because its network effects have not yet
materialized. Response: the transition strategy addresses this through phased
implementation, with each phase providing immediate benefits regardless of later phases.

**2. The Governance Burden.** Participatory governance is time-consuming. Commons
assemblies, adversarial review, sortition service, and participatory budgeting all require
significant time investment from participants. In a society where most people are already
overworked, this is a real barrier. Response: the Ember Economy partially addresses this
through AI-assisted decision support and through the reduced work requirements that
cooperative automation enables. But the governance burden remains a genuine vulnerability.

**3. The External Pressure Problem.** Conventional economies and the states that serve
them will not passively accept the growth of a system that structurally undermines their
power base. The Worgl experiment was shut down by the Austrian central bank. Cooperative
movements have faced legal, economic, and sometimes violent suppression throughout history.
Response: the distributed, forkable, protocol-based architecture of the Ember Economy
makes it harder (not impossible) to shut down than centralized alternatives. But
external pressure remains a serious threat.

**4. The Measurement Problem.** Demurrage rates, concentration caps, compensation ratios,
and Burn Cycle timing all require calibration. Getting them wrong could produce
unintended consequences -- too much demurrage could destroy economic activity; too little
could fail to prevent accumulation. Response: this is why the parameters are adjustable by
assemblies and why the system is designed for experimentation and revision.

**5. The Coordination Problem at Scale.** Polycentric governance works beautifully at
small scales (Ostrom's evidence is strong). Whether it can work at bioregional and
planetary scales is unproven. Response: the internet is a proof-of-concept for
polycentric coordination at planetary scale. TCP/IP coordinates billions of devices
without central authority. The question is whether the same approach can work for economic
governance. The honest answer is: we do not know, and we will not know until we try.

**6. The Human Factor.** The Ember Economy assumes that people will participate in
governance, that they will accept demurrage, that they will not attempt to circumvent
concentration caps through informal arrangements, and that they will not use the Great
Burn as a pretext for nihilistic destruction. Some of these assumptions will prove wrong
for some people some of the time. Response: the system is designed with graduated
sanctions, transparency, and cultural development in mind. It will not work perfectly.
The question is whether it works better than what we have.

**7. The Temporal Discounting Problem.** Humans systematically undervalue future benefits
relative to present costs. The Burn Cycle's greatest benefits (preventing civilizational
collapse from excessive accumulation) are long-term, while its costs (giving up
accumulated stewardship) are immediate and felt. Response: the quarterly Seasonal Cycle
provides more frequent, smaller-scale experiences of redistribution and its benefits,
building cultural familiarity with the logic of periodic reset.

These vulnerabilities are stated here because a model that cannot state its own weaknesses
has not yet taken Pyrrhic Lucidity seriously.

*This document is version 0.1. It is a beginning, not a conclusion. It is incomplete by
design and will be revised through application, collision with reality, and the adversarial
review it demands of all its own mechanisms. The Ember Economy is not a destination. It is
a set of tools for building economic systems that serve the composite self in a world of
contested power, limited resources, and irreducible uncertainty. The fire burns the dead
wood. The ember is what you build from.*
