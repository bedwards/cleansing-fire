## Federal FOIA Templates

### Template 1: General Records Request

```
[DATE]

FOIA Officer
[AGENCY NAME]
[AGENCY FOIA OFFICE ADDRESS]

RE: Freedom of Information Act Request

Dear FOIA Officer:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I request
access to and copies of [DESCRIBE THE RECORDS YOU SEEK WITH AS MUCH
SPECIFICITY AS POSSIBLE — include date ranges, offices, subject matter,
names of officials, and any document types you want].

To help identify the records I seek, I am providing the following
additional details: [CONTEXT ABOUT WHY THESE RECORDS SHOULD EXIST AND
WHERE WITHIN THE AGENCY THEY ARE LIKELY MAINTAINED].

REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the
requested information is in the public interest because it is likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations
or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial
interest. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).

Specifically, [EXPLAIN HOW THE REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS — e.g., "these records
will shed light on the agency's decision-making process regarding..."
and HOW YOU WILL DISSEMINATE THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC — e.g.,
"I intend to publish findings on [website/publication/social media]
reaching [approximate audience size]"].

REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING

[INCLUDE ONLY IF APPLICABLE — DELETE IF NOT]
I request expedited processing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E).
There is [an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged
federal government activity / a threat to someone's life or physical
safety]. Specifically, [EXPLAIN THE URGENT CIRCUMSTANCES].

I certify that the above statements regarding expedited processing
are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

FORMAT

I prefer to receive responsive documents in electronic format
(PDF preferred). If electronic transmission is not possible, please
send records to the address below.

SCOPE

I am willing to accept documents on a rolling basis as they are
identified and reviewed, rather than waiting for a single complete
production.

If you determine that some portions of the requested documents are
exempt from disclosure, please provide me with an index of those
documents and the applicable exemptions, and release all reasonably
segregable non-exempt portions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).

If this request is denied in whole or in part, I ask that you justify
all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Act. I expect
the release of all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.
I reserve the right to appeal any adverse determination.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. The FOIA requires
a response within 20 business days. If you have any questions regarding
this request, please contact me at the address or phone number below.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR ADDRESS]
[YOUR EMAIL]
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]

### Template 2: Appeal of Improper Withholding

```
[DATE]

FOIA Appeals Officer
[AGENCY NAME]
[AGENCY APPEALS OFFICE ADDRESS]

RE: FOIA Appeal — Request No. [TRACKING NUMBER]

Dear Appeals Officer:

I write to appeal the [partial denial / full denial / constructive
denial due to failure to respond] of my Freedom of Information Act
request, tracking number [TRACKING NUMBER], dated [DATE OF ORIGINAL
REQUEST].

ORIGINAL REQUEST

My original request sought [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF REQUESTED RECORDS].
On [DATE OF RESPONSE], [AGENCY] responded by [DESCRIBE THE AGENCY'S
ACTION — e.g., "withholding X documents in full under Exemption 7(A)"
or "failing to respond within the 20-business-day statutory deadline"].

GROUNDS FOR APPEAL

[SELECT APPLICABLE ARGUMENTS AND DELETE OTHERS]

1. OVERBROAD APPLICATION OF EXEMPTION [NUMBER]:
   The agency applied Exemption [NUMBER] too broadly. [EXPLAIN WHY —
   e.g., "Exemption 5 (deliberative process) does not apply because
   these records reflect final agency policy, not pre-decisional
   deliberations" or "Exemption 7(A) does not apply because the
   referenced investigation concluded on [DATE]"].

2. FAILURE TO CONDUCT ADEQUATE SEARCH:
   The agency's search was inadequate because [EXPLAIN — e.g.,
   "the response indicates the agency only searched [Office X],
   but responsive records are also likely maintained by [Office Y]
   based on [reasoning]"].

3. FAILURE TO RELEASE SEGREGABLE PORTIONS:
   Even if certain information is properly exempt, the agency must
   release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions. 5 U.S.C.
   § 552(b). The agency has not demonstrated that it performed
   a line-by-line segregability analysis.

4. PUBLIC INTEREST OVERRIDE:
   The public interest in disclosure outweighs the agency's asserted
   interest in withholding. [EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC PUBLIC INTEREST].

I request that you [reverse the denial and release the records /
order a new, adequate search / release segregable portions].

If this appeal is denied, I intend to pursue judicial review under
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR ADDRESS]
[YOUR EMAIL]

### Template 3: Expedited Processing Request

```
[DATE]

FOIA Officer
[AGENCY NAME]
[AGENCY FOIA OFFICE ADDRESS]

RE: FOIA Request with Expedited Processing — URGENT

Dear FOIA Officer:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and
specifically 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II), I request expedited
processing of the following records request.

RECORDS SOUGHT

[DESCRIBE RECORDS — same format as Template 1]

BASIS FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING

I certify that the following circumstances warrant expedited processing:

[SELECT ONE OR MORE AND DELETE OTHERS]

1. URGENCY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC:
   There is an urgency to inform the public about [DESCRIBE THE ACTUAL
   OR ALLEGED GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY]. This matter is currently the
   subject of [public debate / media coverage / legislative action /
   pending regulatory action]. Delay in processing will render the
   responsive records moot because [EXPLAIN TIME SENSITIVITY — e.g.,
   "the public comment period closes on [DATE]" or "the vote is
   scheduled for [DATE]"].

2. THREAT TO LIFE OR PHYSICAL SAFETY:
   The requested records relate to a threat to the life or physical
   safety of [INDIVIDUAL/GROUP]. Specifically, [DESCRIBE THE THREAT
   AND HOW THE RECORDS RELATE].

3. MEDIA ORGANIZATION REQUEST:
   I am a representative of the news media and there is an urgency
   to inform the public. I am [DESCRIBE YOUR CREDENTIALS AND
   PUBLICATION].

I certify that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and belief.

[REMAINDER OF REQUEST — RECORDS, FEE WAIVER, FORMAT, ETC.]

### Template 4: Request for Vaughn Index

```
[DATE]

FOIA Officer
[AGENCY NAME]
[AGENCY FOIA OFFICE ADDRESS]

RE: Request for Vaughn Index — FOIA No. [TRACKING NUMBER]

Dear FOIA Officer:

In connection with my FOIA request [TRACKING NUMBER], dated [DATE],
I request that the agency provide a Vaughn index for all records
withheld in whole or in part.

The Vaughn index should identify, for each withholding:

1. The document withheld (by type, date, author, and recipient)
2. The specific FOIA exemption(s) claimed
3. A detailed justification for why each exemption applies to
   the specific document or portion withheld
4. The volume of material withheld (page count)

This index is necessary for me to meaningfully evaluate whether
the agency's withholdings are justified and to pursue any
administrative or judicial appeal.

See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL]
```

### Template 5: Follow-Up for Overdue Request

```
[DATE]

FOIA Officer
[AGENCY NAME]
[AGENCY FOIA OFFICE ADDRESS]

RE: Overdue FOIA Request — Tracking No. [TRACKING NUMBER]

Dear FOIA Officer:

I write regarding my FOIA request [TRACKING NUMBER], submitted on
[DATE]. As of today, [NUMBER] business days have elapsed since the
request was filed. The FOIA requires a response within 20 business
days. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).

I have not received [any response / a substantive response / the
requested records].

I respectfully request that you:
1. Confirm receipt of the original request
2. Provide a tracking number if one has not been assigned
3. Provide an estimated completion date
4. Begin releasing any records already processed on a rolling basis

If I do not receive a substantive response within 10 business days,
I will consider this a constructive denial and may pursue
administrative appeal and/or judicial review. Additionally, my
attorney's fees and litigation costs may be recoverable under
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E) if judicial action becomes necessary.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR EMAIL]
```

## Filing Guide

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the right agency**: Federal records → use federal templates. State/local → research your state's public records law (see State Matrix below).

2. **Be specific**: Vague requests get slow responses. Include:
   - Date ranges
   - Names of officials or programs
   - Document types (emails, memos, contracts, correspondence)
   - Office or division within the agency

3. **Request a fee waiver**: Always request one. Cite the public interest standard. If you plan to publish findings (blog, report, social media), say so.

4. **Choose submission method**:
   - **Email**: Fastest acknowledgment. Most agencies accept FOIA by email now.
   - **FOIA.gov**: Federal portal covering 100+ agencies.
   - **MuckRock**: Tracks your request, handles follow-ups, publishes results.
   - **Mail**: Required by some state/local agencies. Use certified mail with return receipt.

5. **Track deadlines**:
   - Federal: 20 business days for initial response
   - Appeal: varies by agency (usually 20 business days)
   - Most states: 5-30 calendar or business days (see State Matrix)

6. **Follow up aggressively**: Use Template 5 at the 25-business-day mark. Many agencies are backlogged and will prioritize squeaky wheels.

7. **Appeal denials**: Always appeal. Agencies deny first; appeals offices often reverse. Use Template 2.

### State Public Records Law Quick Reference

| State | Law | Response Deadline | Fee Waiver Available |
|-------|-----|-------------------|---------------------|
| California | CPRA (Gov. Code § 7920) | 10 days | Yes — public interest |
| Florida | Sunshine Law (§ 119) | Reasonable time | No fees for inspection |
| Illinois | FOIA (5 ILCS 140) | 5 business days | Yes — public purpose |
| Michigan | FOIA (MCL 15.231) | 5 business days | Yes — indigency/public interest |
| Missouri | Sunshine Law (§ 610) | 3 business days | No fees for inspection |
| New York | FOIL (Pub. Officers § 84) | 5 business days | Yes — waiver available |
| Ohio | Public Records (§ 149.43) | Reasonable time | Free copies (some records) |
| Pennsylvania | Right to Know (65 P.S. § 67) | 5 business days | No — but fees must be reasonable |
| Texas | PIA (Gov. Code § 552) | 10 business days | Yes — public interest |
| Virginia | FOIA (§ 2.2-3700) | 5 working days | Yes — public interest |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad**: "All records about immigration" → denied as unduly burdensome. Instead: "All emails between [Official] and [Company] regarding [Topic] between [Date] and [Date]."

2. **Wrong agency**: Research which agency actually holds the records. FOIA only covers the executive branch.

3. **No fee waiver request**: Without it, you may get a bill for hundreds of dollars before records are released.

4. **Giving up after denial**: Most denials are reversible on appeal. Agencies often over-apply exemptions.

5. **Not tracking deadlines**: Set calendar reminders. If the agency misses its deadline, you have legal standing to sue immediately.

### Integration with Cleansing Fire

The `plugins/legal-automation` plugin can generate FOIA requests programmatically:

```bash
echo '{"action": "foia-generate", "agency": "DOJ", "topic": "private prison contracts"}' | plugins/legal-automation
```

The plugin uses these templates as a starting point and customizes them based on:
- Agency-specific submission requirements
- Known FOIA officer contact information
- Previous successful request language for that agency
- Applicable state law variations
