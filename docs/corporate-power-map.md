## 1. Where Power Actually Lives Now

The critical observation: **much (most) of power is held outside of government now.** Government transparency tools -- vote trackers, bill monitors, lobbying disclosures -- are necessary but insufficient. They illuminate the puppet show while the puppeteers operate in private boardrooms, shell companies, and offshore accounts.

This section maps the actual topology of power.

### 1.1 The Shift from Government to Corporate Power

**When it happened:** The transfer accelerated through identifiable phases.

- **1971:** Lewis Powell's memo to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce outlined a strategy for corporate America to systematically capture political institutions. Corporate lobbyists registered in Washington doubled from 8,000 to 15,000 in the following years.
- **1978-1980:** Deregulation began under Carter (airlines 1978, trucking 1980), then accelerated dramatically under Reagan and Thatcher. This was not just policy change -- it was a philosophical revolution: the idea that markets are self-correcting and government is the problem.
- **1980s-1990s:** The "Washington Consensus" exported deregulation globally via IMF and World Bank conditionalities attached to loans. Developing nations were required to privatize state enterprises, liberalize markets, and withdraw government from economic affairs. Special Economic Zones proliferated -- 3,500 across the globe employing 66 million generally low-paid workers with reduced regulation.
- **1999:** Repeal of Glass-Steagall (via Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) allowed commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies to merge. This created the financial megacorps that would crash the economy in 2008 and emerge even larger afterward.
- **2010:** Citizens United v. FEC -- the Supreme Court ruled that corporations have First Amendment rights to spend unlimited money on elections. Since then, super PACs have spent approximately $6.4 billion on federal elections.
- **2010-present:** The post-crisis consolidation. Rather than breaking up the institutions that caused the crisis, the response was bailouts and consolidation. The largest corporations became even larger. The revolving door between government and industry became a superhighway.

**How it works:** The mechanism is not a conspiracy. It is structural. Corporations pursue profit. Profit is maximized by reducing regulation, capturing regulators, externalizing costs, and consolidating market power. Each successful round of capture makes the next round easier. The result is a ratchet effect where corporate power increases monotonically while democratic accountability erodes.

As researcher Terry Hathaway documented in "Neoliberalism as Corporate Power" (2020): "While corporations were powerful before neoliberalism, neoliberalism has undoubtedly expanded their power -- the largest corporations have been more able to realize their interests at the expense of other societal actors than previously."

### 1.2 Private Equity: Invisible Owners of Everything

Private equity is the most invisible and perhaps the most consequential form of corporate power. These firms buy companies using borrowed money (leveraged buyouts), extract value, load the companies with debt, and either flip them or let them collapse. They operate with almost no public accountability.

**The Big Four and Their Scale:**

| Firm | AUM (2025) | Key Holdings |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Blackstone** | $1 trillion | Largest landlord in America (~350,000 rental units), real estate, logistics, life sciences |
| **Apollo Global Management** | $840 billion | Insurance (Athene), distressed assets, credit, retirement services |
| **KKR** | $638 billion | Insurance operations, media, healthcare, infrastructure, aiming for $1T within 5 years |
| **The Carlyle Group** | $420 billion | Defense, aerospace, healthcare, technology, energy |

**Source:** PitchBook PE earnings dashboard; Dealroom "15 Top Private Equity Firms" (2025)

#### 1.2.1 Healthcare

Private equity has invaded nearly every corner of U.S. healthcare. Over $1 trillion was invested in the sector in the decade preceding 2018. The business model: acquire hospitals and practices, assign debt to them, cut labor costs, change service mix to the most lucrative procedures, upcode diagnostic codes to raise prices, then merge, shut down, or sell.

**The human cost:**
- In 2024, PE-backed companies accounted for **21% of all healthcare bankruptcies** and **7 of the 8 largest healthcare bankruptcies**.
- Steward Health Care (owned by Cerberus Capital Management 2010-2020) closed six hospitals, laying off at least 2,650 workers.
- Prospect Medical Holdings filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025.
- A July 2024 JAMA study found hospital assets decreased by **24% in the two years after PE acquisition**, leaving facilities less equipped to care for patients.
- PE-owned Conemaugh Nason Medical Center shuttered OB-GYN and pediatric clinics in 2022, replacing them with higher-revenue cardiology and orthopedics.

#### 1.2.2 Housing

Blackstone owns an estimated 350,000 rental housing units in the U.S. through its BREIT fund and related entities. A CNBC report projected institutional investors could control **40% of U.S. single-family rental homes by 2030**.

**The mechanism:**
- Buy homes in bulk, often in markets where first-time buyers compete.
- Raise rents aggressively -- Blackstone raised rent by **79% in one San Diego building** in 2024.
- Exploit legal loopholes: California's Tenant Protection Act caps annual rent hikes at 10% for existing tenants, so Blackstone has a financial incentive to **evict existing tenants** and charge new tenants market rates.
- Homelessness shot up **18% to a record high** in 2024 while Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman collected over **$1 billion in pay and dividends**.

**Sources:** PE Stakeholder Project, "Blackstone Comes to Collect" (https://pestakeholder.org/reports/blackstone-comes-to-collect/); Moneywise, "The world's largest alternative asset manager is now its largest landlord" (2025)

#### 1.2.3 Media and Infrastructure

KKR, Apollo, and others have acquired media companies, data centers, fiber optic networks, toll roads, water utilities, and energy infrastructure. The pattern is consistent: acquire, extract, and obscure ownership through layers of shell entities. The public often has no idea that the company billing them for water or managing their hospital is ultimately owned by a PE fund in Manhattan.

### 1.3 Tech Platforms as Quasi-Governments

The five largest tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Meta) have a combined market capitalization exceeding $12 trillion. They exercise governmental power without democratic accountability.

**Content moderation as legislation:** When Meta or Google decides what speech is allowed, they are making law for billions of people. The EU's Digital Services Act (2025) recognizes this by integrating a co-regulatory system where risk management for major platforms is overseen by the European Commission. But in the U.S., Section 230 still largely insulates platforms from accountability for their content decisions.

The FTC launched a public inquiry in February 2025 into alleged content-based discrimination by major tech platforms, exploring whether companies engage in "shadow-banning," apply policies inconsistently, or use deceptive practices. The Third Circuit's Anderson decision established that Section 230 does not shield platforms when algorithmic recommendations constitute "expressive activity."

**Algorithmic amplification as policy:** What an algorithm promotes or suppresses is a policy decision with real-world consequences. At least 45 states introduced AI-related bills in 2024. Colorado passed comprehensive legislation to address algorithmic discrimination. But enforcement is minimal.

**Data collection as surveillance:**
- Google processes **8.5 billion searches per day**.
- Advertising revenue accounts for nearly **98% of Meta's revenue** and **77% of Alphabet's**.
- Between 2014 and 2024, Google, Meta, and Apple collectively shared data from over **3.16 million user accounts** with U.S. law enforcement. Google saw a **530% increase** in accounts shared with authorities; Meta experienced a **675% surge**; Apple's disclosures climbed **621%**.
- Amazon Ring partnered with Flock Safety in October 2025. Flock operates over **80,000 AI-powered cameras** across 49 states, performing more than **20 billion vehicle scans per month**.

### 1.4 Media Conglomeration

**Who owns what:** The number of major media conglomerates continues to shrink.

| Conglomerate | Key Assets | Owner/Control |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Comcast** | NBC, MSNBC, Universal Pictures, Sky. Spun off cable networks into "Versant" (late 2025) including Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes | Roberts family (supervoting shares) |
| **Walt Disney Company** | ABC, ESPN, Hulu, Disney+, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar, 20th Century Studios, National Geographic | Institutional investors; board-controlled |
| **Warner Bros. Discovery** | CNN, HBO, TNT, TBS, Discovery+, Max. Announced plans in June 2025 to split streaming/studio from cable networks | David Zaslav (CEO); institutional investors |
| **Paramount Skydance** | CBS, Paramount Pictures, MTV, BET, Nickelodeon, Showtime, Pluto TV | Ellison family (acquired August 2025) |
| **Fox Corporation** | Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports | Murdoch family (supervoting shares) |
| **News Corp** | Wall Street Journal, New York Post, HarperCollins, Dow Jones, realtor.com | Murdoch family |

**The information bottleneck:** A handful of families and institutional investors control what the majority of Americans see, read, and hear. Local news has been gutted -- over 2,500 newspapers have closed since 2005. The survivors are increasingly owned by hedge funds (Alden Global Capital) and PE firms that strip them for parts.

### 1.5 Billionaire Philanthropy as Power Laundering

Philanthropy at the billionaire scale is not charity. It is a mechanism for converting personal wealth into institutional power while receiving tax deductions and public praise.

**The Gates Foundation:** Plans to spend **$10 billion per year until 2045** -- the largest philanthropic commitment in modern history. Since 2010, it has built a bureaucratic infrastructure akin to a diplomatic service, with country offices in London and Berlin and representation in Paris, Brussels, and Stockholm. A 2025 study in *Globalization and Health* documented how the foundation's "network diplomacy" exercises influence over public policy in European donor countries -- challenging "democratic accountability and governance across world regions."

**The Koch Network:** The Charles Koch Foundation donated more than **$1.2 million to ALEC** (American Legislative Exchange Commission) since 2020, mostly through Stand Together Trust. Six billionaire fortunes bankrolled Project 2025 through Heritage Foundation and related entities (DeSmog, 2024). The network's influence extends across think tanks, universities, judicial appointments, and state legislatures.

**The broader pattern:** Billionaires have invested more than **$500 million in advocacy groups** to defend philanthropic interests and control the debate's boundaries. As *Inside Philanthropy* noted: "In recent decades, billionaires have grown far more savvy at using philanthropy to sway politics, deploying ever larger sums across more issues and arenas."

**The tax arbitrage:** Donor-advised funds (DAFs) at Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard allow wealthy donors to take an immediate tax deduction while retaining advisory control over when and where the money goes -- with no legal deadline to distribute the funds. DAFs funneled at least **$171 million** to nonprofits behind Project 2025 (DeSmog, 2024).

**Sources:** DeSmog, "6 Billionaire Fortunes Bankrolling Project 2025" (https://www.desmog.com/2024/08/14/project-2025-billionaire-donor-heritage-foundation-donald-trump-jd-vance-charles-koch-peter-coors/); Inside Philanthropy (https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/); Globalization and Health, "The Gates Foundation's network diplomacy in European donor countries" (https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-025-01112-9)

### 1.6 Supply Chain Power

Two companies dominate American retail and increasingly control what consumers can buy, at what price, and how fast they can get it.

**Amazon** aims to control **20% of the U.S. grocery market by 2030**. Its robots are involved in nearly **75% of global deliveries**, with over **1 million robots** in warehouses. Its prices average **14% lower** than major online competitors -- a competitive moat that smaller retailers cannot match. Amazon controls the product journey from manufacturer to doorstep through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), which makes third-party sellers dependent on Amazon's infrastructure while Amazon collects their sales data and can launch competing products.

**Walmart** gets **60% of its revenue from groceries** and recently opened its first proprietary meat-processing facility, cutting out middlemen in its beef supply chain. Its supplier relationships give it effective veto power over the survival of consumer goods companies.

**The power dynamic:** When two companies control enough of the retail market, they set the terms for every supplier in their ecosystem. A consumer goods company that loses Walmart or Amazon shelf space can face existential crisis. This is not market competition -- it is feudal power with a capitalist interface.

### 1.7 Financial System Power

#### 1.7.1 The Big Three: Passive Ownership of Everything

| Firm | ETF Market Share | Key Fact |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Vanguard** | 30.1% | Largest shareholder in most S&P 500 companies |
| **BlackRock** | 29.4% | $10+ trillion AUM, largest asset manager on Earth |
| **State Street** | 14.8% | SPDR ETFs, custody of $43+ trillion |

Together, the Big Three:
- Control **74.3% of the entire equity ETF market**.
- Constitute the **largest shareholder in more than 40%** of publicly traded U.S. firms and **88% of the S&P 500**.
- Own about **25% of voting shares** in corporate America.
- In the 2025 proxy season, backed **98.7%** of management-sponsored resolutions.

This is not a conspiracy -- it is a structural consequence of passive index investing. But the effect is the same: three firms have veto power over corporate governance for virtually every major American company.

**Sources:** Cambridge University Press, "Hidden power of the Big Three?" (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-and-politics/article/hidden-power-of-the-big-three-passive-index-funds-reconcentration-of-corporate-ownership-and-new-financial-risk/); U.S. News, "These 3 Fund Families Control 74% of the Equity ETF Market" (https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/these-3-fund-families-control-74-of-the-market)

#### 1.7.2 Credit Rating Agencies

Three agencies -- **Moody's** (~40% market share), **S&P Global** (~40%), and **Fitch** (~15%) -- control **more than 90%** of the global ratings market. Their opinions influence trillions of dollars in investments, determine borrowing costs for corporations and entire nations, and shape bank capital requirements under Basel III.

The conflict of interest is structural: corporations pay fees to the very agencies that rate their debt. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission stated: "There was a clear failure of corporate governance at Moody's, which did not ensure the quality of its ratings on tens of thousands of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs." No meaningful reform followed.

#### 1.7.3 SWIFT and Financial Weaponization

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) processes the majority of international financial transactions. Its coercive power became fully evident in 2022 when seven major Russian banks were excluded -- a move one French official described as "the financial nuclear weapon."

As of early 2025, the U.S. dollar accounts for about **50% of SWIFT transaction value**, the euro approximately **23%**, and the yuan under **4%**. However, the weaponization of SWIFT is driving development of alternatives: Russia's SPFS, China's CIPS, and various bilateral arrangements. The long-term consequence may be financial system fragmentation into competing blocs.

(https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2022/eb_22-09)

---

### 1.8 Regulatory Capture

Regulatory capture is not a bug -- it is the primary bridge between corporate and government power. The mechanism is the revolving door.

**The evidence:**
- A study of **6,430 directors and executive officers** of S&P 500 companies found systematic patterns of regulatory capture through executive transitions.
- Yale SOM research found that firms receive regulatory benefits **in the two-year window before** they hire a former regulator -- suggesting the promise of future employment is itself a form of capture.
- In the Department of Health and Human Services, **15% of appointees** (2004-2020) came directly from private industry, and **32% exited to industry** at the end of their tenure.
- Jeffrey Merrifield, Nuclear Regulatory Commission member (1997-2008), voted twice on matters involving companies he had contacted about job prospects, then left to take an executive position at The Shaw Group, regulated by the NRC.

**The ratchet:** Regulators who might impose meaningful constraints on corporate behavior know that their future income depends on the goodwill of the industries they regulate. This does not require corruption in the traditional sense -- it is structural incentive alignment that produces the same outcomes.

**Sources:** Yale Insights, "U.S. Government Regulators May Be Favoring Their Future Private-Sector Employers" (https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/us-government-regulators-may-be-favoring-their-future-private-sector-employers); Health Affairs, "The Revolving Door In Health Care Regulation" (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.00418)

### 1.9 Dark Money Networks

Dark money hit a **record $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races** -- nearly double the prior record of $1 billion in 2020 (Brennan Center for Justice).

**The architecture of anonymity:**

1. **501(c)(4) organizations** -- "social welfare" nonprofits that can spend on elections without disclosing donors. They sponsored **$242 million** in ads during the 2023-24 cycle.
2. **Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)** -- Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard operate the largest DAF sponsors, serving as anonymizing intermediaries. At least **$171 million** flowed through DAFs to Project 2025 nonprofits.
3. **Donors Trust / Bradley Impact Fund** -- specialized intermediaries that shield original donor identities while making grants to political organizations.
4. **Shell companies to Super PACs** -- In the 2024 cycle, shell companies and 501(c) nonprofits that did not disclose their funding sources gave **$1.3 billion** to super PACs -- more than in the prior two election cycles combined.

**The result:** The public has no way to trace most political spending back to its source. Corporations, billionaires, and foreign interests can influence elections while maintaining complete deniability.

**Sources:** Brennan Center for Justice, "Dark Money Hit a Record High of $1.9 Billion in 2024 Federal Races" (https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/dark-money-hit-record-high-19-billion-2024-federal-races); OpenSecrets, "By the Numbers: 15 Years of Citizens United" (https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2025/01/by-the-numbers-15-years-of-citizens-united/); DeSmog, "The Friendly New Face of Dark Money" (https://www.desmog.com/2024/10/28/friendly-new-face-dark-money-fidelity-schwab-vanguard-donor-advised-funds-daf-project-2025/)

### 1.10 International Power Structures

#### World Economic Forum (WEF)

The WEF is not a government, but it convenes the people who run governments and corporations in the same room. Its year-round membership consists exclusively of **1,000 of the world's biggest multinational corporations**, most with more than $5 billion in turnover. Big companies pay large fees to be partners.

The WEF's Board of Trustees includes **Ajay S. Banga** (President, World Bank), **Kristalina Georgieva** (Managing Director, IMF), and -- until his resignation in February 2026 -- **Borge Brende** as head of the WEF. In a telling detail: **Laurence D. Fink** (CEO of BlackRock) was elected WEF Co-Chair in August 2025.

**Source:** Transnational Institute, "World Economic Forum: a history and analysis" (https://www.tni.org/en/article/world-economic-forum-a-history-and-analysis)

#### IMF / World Bank / BIS

These institutions set the rules of the global financial system. IMF conditionalities attached to loans have forced austerity, privatization, and deregulation on dozens of countries. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) -- the "central bank of central banks" -- sets capital standards (Basel III) that determine how banks operate worldwide.

International treaties and trade agreements increasingly function as corporate law. Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions allow corporations to sue nation-states in private tribunals if their investments are jeopardized by regulation. This gives multinational corporations legal authority to override democratic decisions.

### 2.3 Beneficial Ownership Registries

#### 2.3.1 FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI)

**Current status (March 2025):** The interim final rule published March 26, 2025 **removed the requirement for U.S. companies and U.S. persons** to report beneficial ownership information. Only entities formed under the law of a foreign country that have registered to do business in the U.S. are now required to report. This is a significant setback for corporate transparency.

**E-filing portal:** https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/

**What this means for us:** The U.S. beneficial ownership registry that was supposed to bring transparency is effectively gutted for domestic entities. We must rely on alternative data sources for domestic beneficial ownership.

---

### 2.6 Supply Chain Mapping

#### 2.6.1 ImportGenius

**What it is:** Trade intelligence platform covering 24+ jurisdictions with daily shipment updates and AI-powered company profiler.

**API access:** Available. Structured exports (CSV/XLSX/API) for BI, CRM, and ERP workflows.

#### 2.6.3 Supply Chain Disclosure Requirements

California's Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act require certain large companies to disclose supply chain practices. These filings are public but not centrally aggregated in any easily machine-readable format -- a gap we can fill.

---

### 2.7 Real Estate and Property Ownership

**Current state:** Property ownership data is fragmented across **3,000+ county recorder offices** in the U.S. Each county maintains its own database with different formats, access methods, and fees.

**What is available:**
- County assessor databases (property characteristics, assessed value, owner name)
- County recorder databases (deeds, mortgages, liens, transfers)
- NETR Online (https://publicrecords.netronline.com/) -- index of county-level public records portals

**Commercial aggregators:**
- PropertyShark (https://www.propertyshark.com/) -- property records, ownership chains, LLC lookups
- ATTOM Data -- bulk property data API (expensive, enterprise-focused)
- CoreLogic -- largest property data aggregator (paywalled, enterprise pricing)

**The LLC problem:** Corporate landlords typically own property through layers of LLCs. Tracing beneficial ownership of real estate requires cross-referencing property records with corporate registry data (state Secretary of State filings) and sometimes beneficial ownership registries -- when they exist.

**Cost:** Most county records are free or low-cost to search individually. Bulk access varies wildly. Commercial aggregators charge thousands per month.

---

### 2.8 Corporate Court Filings

- **PacerMonitor** (https://www.pacermonitor.com/) -- RESTful API for normalized data from 200+ federal courts.

#### 2.8.2 State Court Records

No unified system exists. Each state has its own court record system. Many are searchable online but with inconsistent formats and no APIs. This is a major gap.

---

### 2.9 ESG / Sustainability Reporting

- **Wikirate** (https://wikirate.org/) -- open ESG data platform. Includes Good Jobs First Violation Tracker data.
- **CDP** (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) -- corporate environmental disclosures. Paywalled for bulk data.
- **SASB Standards** -- sector-specific sustainability disclosure standards. Now part of IFRS Foundation.
- **GRI Database** -- sustainability reports searchable by company. Free search, bulk access unclear.

- **Equilar** -- board composition and executive compensation analytics (commercial)

---

### 2.11 Private Company Data

| Source | Coverage | Cost | API |
|--------|----------|------|-----|
| **PitchBook** | Most comprehensive private market data. PE, VC, M&A | ~$20,000/year minimum per user | Custom API pricing |
| **Crunchbase** | Startups, VC funding, company profiles | $29-49/user/month | Available on paid plans |
| **Preqin** | Alternative assets (PE, hedge funds, real estate) | Enterprise pricing | Available |
| **PrivCo** | Private company financials | Enterprise pricing | Limited |

**The transparency gap:** Private companies are not required to file with the SEC (unless they have debt securities or >$10M in assets and 2,000+ shareholders). Private equity portfolio companies are largely invisible to public scrutiny. This is the single largest gap in corporate transparency.

---

### 2.12 Tax Haven / Shell Company Tracking

### 2.13 Corporate Political Spending Post-Citizens United

**Key data sources for tracking:**

| Source | URL | What It Tracks | Cost |
|--------|-----|----------------|------|
| **OpenSecrets** | opensecrets.org | Super PAC spending, dark money, lobbying, contributions | Free (API: 200 calls/day) |
| **FEC** | fec.gov/data | Disclosed campaign contributions, PAC spending, independent expenditures | Free (API key required) |
| **Brennan Center** | brennancenter.org | Dark money analysis, policy research | Free (reports) |
| **Issue One** | issueone.org | Dark money illuminated, top dark money groups | Free (reports) |
| **Public Citizen** | citizen.org | Corporate political spending analysis | Free (reports) |
| **ProPublica Campaign Finance API** | projects.propublica.org/api-docs/campaign-finance/ | FEC data with enhanced search | Free |

**The disclosure gap:** Since Citizens United, **$1.9 billion in dark money** flowed into the 2024 election cycle alone. Shell companies and 501(c) nonprofits gave **$1.3 billion** to super PACs without disclosing their funding sources. Existing tools can track disclosed spending effectively, but the dark money pipeline remains largely opaque by design.

### 3.4 Academic Research

#### The Network of Global Corporate Control (Vitali, Glattfelder, Battiston, 2011)

**The landmark study.** Analyzed ownership relationships among **43,060 transnational corporations** using the Orbis 2007 database (37 million economic actors, 13 million ownership links across 194 countries).

**Key findings:**
- **147 companies** form a tightly-knit core controlling about **40% of the value** of all transnational corporations.
- Three-quarters of this core are **financial intermediaries**.
- Among the top 50 companies, **45 are financial firms** (Barclays PLC identified as most influential, along with JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and others).
- The structure forms a "bow-tie" topology -- a small core with disproportionate control.

**Methodology:** Network analysis using graph theory on ownership data. This is the template for what we should build as a living, real-time system.

**Source:** Vitali S, Glattfelder JB, Battiston S (2011) "The Network of Global Corporate Control." PLoS ONE 6(10): e25995. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025995

### 3.5 Technology

#### Neo4j and Graph Databases

**Why graph databases matter for corporate power mapping:** Corporate power structures are inherently graph-shaped -- nodes (companies, people, funds) connected by edges (ownership, board membership, lobbying relationships, campaign contributions). Relational databases struggle with the traversal queries essential to answering "who ultimately controls this entity?"

**Key tools:**

| Tool | Purpose | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Neo4j** | Graph database. Cypher query language for pattern matching on graph data | Community edition: free, open source. Enterprise: paid |
| **Linkurious Enterprise** | Graph visualization for threat detection and intelligence analysis on top of Neo4j | Commercial (enterprise pricing) |
| **GraphAware Hume** | Government-grade graph analytics platform | Commercial |
| **Oligrapher** (LittleSis) | Open-source power map visualization | Free, open source |
| **Gephi** | Open-source network analysis and visualization | Free |

**ICIJ's approach:** The ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database is built on Neo4j. Their data packages are available for download in Neo4j format: https://github.com/ICIJ/offshoreleaks-data-packages

## 4. Gaps -- What Does Not Exist Yet

This is where Cleansing Fire has the opportunity to build something that does not exist. The tools above are fragmented, specialized, and largely inaccessible to non-experts. No one has built the integrated, real-time, AI-powered corporate power monitoring system that is the equivalent of what we are building for government.

### 4.1 Real-Time Corporate Power Monitoring

**What exists:** SEC EDGAR provides real-time filing data. OpenSecrets and FEC provide periodic updates on political spending. LittleSis provides a static (manually updated) relationship database.

**What does not exist:** A system that continuously monitors corporate filings, ownership changes, lobbying disclosures, court filings, political spending, and news -- and automatically updates a unified corporate power graph in real time. The equivalent of a radar system for corporate power moves.

**What we would build:** An agent that monitors SEC EDGAR's real-time filing stream, OpenSecrets bulk data updates, FEC electronic filing updates, state corporate registry changes, PACER new filings, and news feeds -- then automatically extracts entities, relationships, and events to update a living power graph.

### 4.2 Automated Beneficial Ownership Chain Resolution

**What exists:** OpenCorporates provides corporate relationship data. OpenOwnership provides beneficial ownership data for a few countries. FinCEN BOI was gutted in March 2025 for domestic companies.

**What does not exist:** An automated system that takes any entity (company, LLC, trust, fund) and traces the ownership chain upward through layers of intermediaries to identify the ultimate beneficial owner(s). This requires cross-referencing:
- SEC filings (13D/13G for public companies)
- State Secretary of State corporate registries (50 separate databases)
- OpenCorporates data
- Property records (for real estate ownership chains)
- Trust instruments (often not public)
- Foreign corporate registries

**The hard problem:** Shell companies, nominee directors, bearer shares (in some jurisdictions), trusts, and multi-layered holding structures are specifically designed to defeat this kind of analysis. AI-powered pattern recognition could identify suspicious structures even when the ownership chain cannot be fully resolved.

### 4.3 AI-Powered Corporate Filing Analysis

**What exists:** SEC filings are available as structured XBRL data (financial statements) and unstructured text (risk factors, management discussion, legal proceedings). Moody's and other compliance firms use AI for KYC/AML beneficial ownership detection.

**What does not exist:** An AI system that reads corporate filings and extracts power concentration indicators:
- Unusual risk factor language suggesting regulatory capture
- Executive compensation structures that incentivize extraction over investment
- Subsidiary proliferation patterns suggesting tax avoidance or liability shielding
- Related-party transactions that indicate self-dealing
- Changes in auditor language or going-concern warnings
- Patterns in 8-K filings that suggest coordinated corporate actions

**What we would build:** An LLM-powered agent that processes the full text of SEC filings, extracts structured data on power relationships, and flags anomalies. Combined with the XBRL financial data, this provides both quantitative and qualitative analysis of corporate behavior.

### 4.4 Cross-Referencing Corporate Networks with Political Influence

**What exists:** OpenSecrets tracks political spending. LittleSis tracks relationships. SEC filings track corporate structure. These are separate databases with no automated cross-referencing.

**What does not exist:** A unified graph that connects:
- Corporate ownership chains (SEC 13F, 13D/13G, Exhibit 21)
- Board interlocks (proxy statements)
- Lobbying relationships (OpenSecrets, LobbyView)
- Campaign contributions (FEC, OpenSecrets)
- Revolving door moves (executive career tracking)
- Regulatory outcomes (agency rulemaking + court decisions)
- Legislative outcomes (bill text + vote records)

When you can query "show me every company connected to Senator X through board members, lobbyists, campaign contributions, and regulatory decisions" -- and get an answer in seconds -- that is when corporate power becomes visible.

### 4.5 Making Corporate Power as Visible as Government Power

**The asymmetry:** Government power is relatively transparent by design -- votes are recorded, bills are published, regulatory proceedings are documented. Corporate power is opaque by design -- held through layers of legal entities, private transactions, and non-disclosure agreements.

**What we need:** A system that takes the fragmented, scattered, deliberately obscured data about corporate power and presents it with the same clarity that a bill tracker provides for legislation. Not just for experts -- for journalists, activists, and citizens who want to understand who actually controls the systems that affect their lives.

### 4.6 Accessible Tools for Non-Experts

**The current state:** Most corporate research tools require specialized knowledge. EDGAR filings require understanding of accounting and securities law. PACER requires understanding of legal procedure. OpenCorporates requires understanding of corporate structures. Graph databases require technical expertise.

**What does not exist:** A natural-language interface where a journalist can ask "who owns the hospital that just closed in my town?" and get a traced ownership chain from the hospital entity through holding companies to the PE fund that made the decision. Or where an activist can ask "which companies are lobbying against this environmental regulation, and what politicians do they fund?" and get a visualized answer.

### 5.4 Fusion with Existing Civic Data Pipeline

The corporate intelligence system should fuse with the existing Cleansing Fire civic data pipeline at multiple points:

1. **Legislator profiles:** Existing legislator tracking + OpenSecrets contribution data + lobbying data = complete picture of which corporate interests influence each legislator.

2. **Bill analysis:** Existing bill monitoring + InfluenceMap lobbying data + corporate filings mentioning specific regulations = understanding of which corporate interests shaped each piece of legislation.

3. **Regulatory monitoring:** Existing government monitoring + revolving door tracking (career paths of regulators) + corporate lobbying on specific rules = regulatory capture detection.

4. **Judicial monitoring:** Court decision tracking + corporate litigant analysis + judge appointment/campaign contribution data = understanding of corporate influence on judicial outcomes.

**The key insight:** Government power and corporate power are not separate systems. They are deeply intertwined. The civic data pipeline and the corporate intelligence pipeline must be a single integrated graph where the connections between government actors and corporate actors are first-class relationships.

**Agent behaviors:**

- **Filing Monitor Agent:** Runs continuously. Polls EDGAR every 60 seconds for new filings. For each new filing: extracts entities (companies, people, amounts), identifies relationships (ownership, compensation, transactions), and updates the graph. Uses local LLM (via Gatekeeper) for text extraction from unstructured sections; uses XBRL API for structured financial data.

- **Political Money Agent:** Runs on schedule (daily for FEC, weekly for OpenSecrets bulk). Matches political spending records to entities in the corporate graph. Identifies new connections between corporate entities and political actors. Flags large or unusual spending patterns.

- **Ownership Resolver Agent:** Runs on demand (triggered when a new entity enters the graph or when a user queries ownership). Traverses corporate registries, SEC filings, and beneficial ownership databases to build ownership chains. Caches resolved chains with TTL based on data freshness.

- **Network Analysis Agent:** Runs weekly. Computes graph centrality metrics (betweenness, eigenvector, PageRank) to identify the most influential nodes. Detects community structures (clusters of closely connected entities). Compares current graph to historical snapshots to detect structural changes.

- **Alert Agent:** Runs continuously. Monitors the graph for threshold events: new beneficial ownership above 5%, executive departures, large political contributions, regulatory filings, court actions. Generates alerts based on configurable rules.

- **Report Generator Agent:** Runs on demand. Takes a natural language query ("Who controls Steward Health Care and what politicians do they fund?"), translates it to graph queries, retrieves relevant data, and generates a human-readable report with sources and confidence levels.

### 5.6 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Graph Database** | Neo4j Community Edition | Free, open source, industry standard for relationship data. ICIJ uses it. Cypher query language is expressive for power mapping queries |
| **Data Ingestion** | Python 3.9+ (stdlib + requests) | Consistent with Cleansing Fire conventions. Minimal dependencies |
| **LLM Integration** | Gatekeeper daemon (Ollama) + Claude API | Local LLM for high-volume text extraction. Claude for complex analysis and report generation |
| **Scheduling** | Existing Cleansing Fire scheduler | Cron-like scheduling for periodic agents + event triggers |
| **Visualization** | Oligrapher (open source from LittleSis) or custom D3.js | Oligrapher is purpose-built for power maps. D3.js for custom visualizations |
| **Entity Resolution** | Custom + OpenSanctions yente | Matching entities across different data sources is the hardest technical problem. yente provides a starting framework |
| **Search** | Elasticsearch or SQLite FTS5 | Full-text search over extracted filing text and entity metadata |

### 5.7 Build Priorities

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
1. Set up Neo4j graph database with schema for entities (Person, Company, Fund, Government Agency) and relationships (OWNS, SITS_ON_BOARD, LOBBIES, FUNDS, EMPLOYS, REGULATES).
2. Build `sec-edgar-monitor` plugin -- ingest 13F, 13D/13G, and Exhibit 21 data.
3. Build `opensecrets-fetcher` plugin -- ingest lobbying and contribution data.
4. Build `littlesis-fetcher` plugin -- bootstrap the graph with existing relationship data.
5. Build basic `network-builder` to merge data into the graph with entity resolution.

**Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)**
1. Build `filing-analyzer` -- LLM-powered extraction from unstructured filing text.
2. Build `ownership-chain-resolver` -- multi-source ownership chain tracing.
3. Build `political-cross-ref` -- link corporate entities to political influence.
4. Integrate with existing civic data pipeline (legislator profiles, bill tracking).
5. Build basic `power-query` -- natural language queries against the graph.

**Phase 3: Autonomy (Weeks 9-12)**
1. Deploy Filing Monitor Agent for continuous EDGAR monitoring.
2. Deploy Political Money Agent for FEC/OpenSecrets monitoring.
3. Deploy Alert Agent with configurable thresholds.
4. Build `power-viz` for graph visualization.
5. Build `report-generator` for human-readable output.

**Phase 4: Scale (Weeks 13+)**
1. Add international data sources (UK Companies House, EU Transparency Register).
2. Integrate supply chain data (ImportGenius or similar).
3. Add court filing monitoring (CourtListener).
4. Build public-facing interface for journalists and activists.
5. Replicate the Vitali et al. analysis on current data -- produce an updated "Network of Global Corporate Control" as a living, real-time system.
