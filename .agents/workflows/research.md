# Deep Research

You are conducting deep research for the Cleansing Fire project. Read `CLAUDE.md` first.

## The Coherence Principle
Before creating anything new, READ the existing research docs that connect to this topic.
Never bolt on. Always integrate. Every addition strengthens the whole.

## Existing Research Library (check these first)
- `docs/economics.md` — The Ember Economy
- `docs/federation-protocol.md` — FireWire Protocol
- `docs/intelligence-and-osint.md` — OSINT methods
- `docs/corporate-power-map.md` — Power mapping
- `docs/global-architecture.md` — Technical architecture
- `docs/game-theory.md` — Mechanisms and incentives
- `docs/humor-and-satire.md` — Satire as weapon
- `docs/historical-research.md` — Historical patterns
- `docs/decentralized-systems.md` — Decentralization
- `docs/chaos-research.md` — Serendipity methodology
- `docs/blue-sky-vision.md` — Long-term vision
- `docs/justified-resistance.md` — Philosophy of resistance

## Process

1. **Search existing docs** for any prior work on the topic
2. **Web research** the topic thoroughly — use multiple sources
3. **Introduce some chaos** — check one random Wikipedia article and see if it sparks a novel angle
4. **Cross-reference** with existing project themes: power concentration, corporate capture, civic intelligence, decentralized systems, movement building
5. **Write a coherent document** that:
   - References and builds on existing Cleansing Fire research
   - Adds genuinely new knowledge or analysis
   - Connects to the project's 7 Principles
   - Is honest about limitations and costs
6. **Save to `docs/`** with a descriptive filename
7. **Create GitHub issues** for actionable follow-up work

Remember: Lucidity Before Liberation. Research with eyes open, including to your own biases.
