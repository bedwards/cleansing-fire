# Investigation Template: Regulatory Capture

Investigate whether an industry has captured its regulatory body — turning the regulator into a protector of industry rather than the public.

## Target
[INDUSTRY] regulated by [AGENCY/REGULATOR]

## Phase 1: Revolving Door (plugins/lobby-tracker)
- Former regulators now working in the industry
- Former industry executives now at the regulatory agency
- Timeline of career moves
- Cooling-off period violations
- Advisory committee membership overlap

## Phase 2: Lobbying Pressure
### Direct Lobbying (plugins/lobby-tracker)
- Total industry spending on lobbying this agency
- Most active lobbying firms
- Specific regulations lobbied for/against
- Meetings between industry and regulators (FOIA)

### Campaign Finance (plugins/civic-fec)
- Industry donations to members of oversight committees
- Donations to officials who appoint regulators
- Industry PAC spending patterns
- Donations timed around key regulatory decisions

## Phase 3: Regulatory Actions
### Legislation (plugins/civic-legiscan)
- Industry-friendly bills introduced
- Deregulation efforts
- Bills that weaken the agency's authority or budget
- Self-regulation provisions

### Enforcement (plugins/news-monitor + FOIA)
- Enforcement actions: frequency and severity over time
- Fines as percentage of industry revenue (cost of doing business?)
- Consent decrees and settlement patterns
- Cases dropped or reduced
- Comparison to peer agencies or previous administrations

## Phase 4: Industry Structure (plugins/corp-sec)
- Industry concentration (how many companies, market share)
- Trade associations and their political spending
- Industry-funded research organizations
- Industry-funded think tanks
- Self-regulatory organizations controlled by industry

## Phase 5: Impact on Public
- Consumer/public harms attributed to weak regulation
- Environmental or health impacts
- Financial costs to the public
- Comparison: countries with stronger regulation of the same industry
- Academic research on regulatory effectiveness

## Phase 6: Cross-Reference (plugins/civic-crossref)
- Correlation: industry donations → favorable regulatory outcomes
- Correlation: revolving door hires → enforcement changes
- Timeline: lobbying campaigns → rule changes
- Pattern: industry comment letters → final rule text overlap

## Capture Indicators
Score each indicator (0-3):
- [ ] Revolving door is active and normalized
- [ ] Enforcement has declined over time
- [ ] Fines are trivial relative to profits
- [ ] Agency budget has been cut
- [ ] Industry writes its own rules (via comments, advisory committees)
- [ ] Regulator adopts industry framing and language
- [ ] Whistleblowers are punished, not protected
- [ ] Public participation in rulemaking is low/ineffective
- [ ] Agency leadership comes from the regulated industry
- [ ] Academic experts critical of the industry are excluded
